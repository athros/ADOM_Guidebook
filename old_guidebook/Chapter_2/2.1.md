# 2.1 The early levels of the Caverns of Chaos (CoC)

The early levels of the CoC should not be a problem for PCs that manage to make it this 
far. They are comparable in difficulty to the Village Dungeon or the Unremarkable Dungeon. 
It is never wise to become overconfident, however. Even these levels may contain lesser 
vaults, tension rooms and named artifact guardians. There may be a split in the early 
dungeon levels of the CoC. Two down staircases may be available. This is by no means 
guaranteed.

When two down staircases are found on D: n (n=1, 2 or 3), the level D: n+1 has a roughly 
50% chance of containing a lesser vault. The level S: n+1 will never contain a vault. 
This suggests the S level may stand for 'S'afe or 'S'hortcut.

The main objective in the early part of the CoC is to find the Arena. More about the 
Arena level is found in section 2.2.
