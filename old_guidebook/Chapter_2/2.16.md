# 2.16 The Water Temple

The Water Temple, found on either D: 19 or D: 20, is the first elemental temple that most 
PCs will encounter. The layout, on the left side of the level, is as follows:

```
   ##########################            #######
  ##........................##           #.....#
 ##..======================..##          #..<..###############   #########
 #..========================..#          #...@...............#   #.......#

 #..========================..#                      #........./.......#

  ##........................##                       #.........# #.....#
   ##########################                        ########### #######
```

The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging.  Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the traps. Note 
the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the 
orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are 
very dangerous. The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC 
instantly should he step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of 
Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in 
the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Water Temple are 
arrayed as follows:

```
   ##########################            #######
  ##...........xx...........##           #.....#
 ##x.======================.x##          #..<..###############   #########
 #..========================..#          #...@...............#   #.......#

 #..========================..#                      #........./.......#
 ##x.======================.x##                      #.........###...>.#
  ##...........xx...........##                       #.........# #.....#
   ##########################                        ########### #######
```

They are: 
* s - water snakes
* x - water grues
* & - water demons
* C - chaos servants
* E - water elementals
* s - (in the center) Snake from Beyond


To attack the temple, the PC must dig in, have a means of crossing the water, then attack 
the monsters. They are all vulnerable to fire based attacks. The grues and demons in 
particular are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee attack that has a very 
high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them eventually - a good reason to 
develop the PCs missile weapon skills. The snakes, including the Snake from Beyond, are 
poisonous. Invisibility is tremendously useful. The only monster found here who sees 
invisible is the Snake from Beyond.


## 2.16.1 The Snake from Beyond

The Snake from Beyond has been beefed up in recent gammas and is now a formidable opponent. 
It generally does not kill a PC that has made it this far, but has nasty poisonous and 
corrupting attacks that rarely miss. If possible, it should be killed from a distance, 
easier said than done in the close quarters of the Water Temple. Unfortunately, it is not 
vulnerable to any type of slaying ammo.

An examination of the Snake from Beyond with a blessed stethoscope reveals:

* You examine the Snake from Beyond. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 45, PV: 22, Hits: 477, Attacks: 1, Damage: 12-56. Speed: 101.

Very high hitpoints and formidable DV/PV for a PC at this level.

The Snake from Beyond holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Water, 
greater identified as follows:

----------------- 
uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10}
----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points of damage. 
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +10.

(full heal + corruption when 'U'sed)
