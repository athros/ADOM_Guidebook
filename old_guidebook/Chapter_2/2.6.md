# 2.6 The Old Barbarian's Glade

The Old Barbarian can be found in a clearing in the center of the wilderness map. He 
assigns a quest to kill a score (20) of the monsters the PC first killed. As a reward for 
successfully completing the quest he teaches the Courage skill. The quest is only 
available to non-chaotics and is not available until the PC has killed 500 monsters.  
Note that if the PC somehow acquires the Courage skill after the quest is assigned but 
before it is completed (bard class power, potion of education), returns to the Old 
Barbarian and 'C'hats with him, he is surprised and gives the PC an ordinary two-handed 
sword.

For more about strategy for the first kill, see section 0.9.1.

Note that the Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items. He is the only 
monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly generated is going to run 
away with the PC's stuff. If the PC leaves items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will 
not have time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.
