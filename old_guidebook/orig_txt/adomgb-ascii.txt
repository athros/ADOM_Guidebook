PREFACE TO THE ASCII VERSION

This document is the ASCII portion of the ADOM Guidebook.  It is a compilation 
of the web pages at http://www.andywlms.com/adom . There is a mirror at 
http://users.rcn.com/andy.williams/adom . The web pages are live and evolving 
documents.  The latest version of the ADOM Guidebook will always be found on 
the web sites.

This ASCII compilation contains only the "meat" of the Guidebook. Additional 
features are available from the web site - color maps, ADOM demos, some ADOM 
humor and a history of updates.

This version was compiled March 13th, 2005.


INTRODUCTION

The ADOM Guidebook is intended to be a definitive reference for ADOM and 
as such contains spoilers throughout.  There is no provision made to 
protect newer players from spoilers, so if you want to figure out the game 
for yourself, this guide is not appropriate.

The Guidebook started as simply ASCII (with some primitive HTML enhancement), 
but is now being expanded to take advantage of the more advanced features 
that HTML offers.  HTML and ASCII compilations are available for download 
and offline reference.  These versions will remain synced.  The compilations 
are updated as revisions to the web pages warrant.  Bear in mind that the web 
pages are undergoing constant corrections and additions.  The most recent 
version of these documents will always be found on the web.

These documents are now under construction relative to ADOM 1.1.x. There are 
archives of the gamma 16 prerelease 2 versions available.

The Guidebook is the work of the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.adom 
and all comments, criticisms and suggestions should be posted there for 
public debate.  Those with World Wide Web access but no Usenet access can 
post to the newsgroup via a Web-based Usenet archive such as Supernews

0.1 Races, classes and their combination


0.1.1 General characteristics

A list of the races can be found in the ADOM manual. It also gives a bit of background 
about each, much of which is flavor and irrelevant in terms of gameplay.

Each race has unique characteristics including initial alignment, trained skills and 
modifiers to attributes. Skills in ADOM vary in terms of availability. All PCs are born 
with First Aid and Listening. All PCs other than Beastfighters and Barbarians with a 
Learning score of 10 or greater are born with Literacy. Many skills can be taught or 
trained by various NPCs during the game. Other skills are much more difficult to obtain 
if the PC is not born with them. Skills other than Alertness and Healing can be wished 
for. Any skill can be obtained from a potion of education, but this is a matter of 
random chance and cannot be counted on. Skills available only from wishes or potions of 
education are referred to as "Nonguaranteed Skills" for the sake of the tables below. 
The first table shows the starting alignment and trained skills that each race is born 
with.

There are definite effects on gameplay depending on the alignment, skills and birthsign 
the PC is born with. Note that none of the races is born with the Healing skill; it is 
entirely class-dependent. Nine classes are born with Healing. It is essential to obtain 
this skill. This means that those without it *must* choose Rynt's quest as opposed to 
Guth'Alak's in Terinyo, whether they intend to actually obtain the skill from Jharod or 
Kranf Niest. This puts restrictions on the game right away, since the Keethrax quest and 
thus a guaranteed artifact and potion of cure corruption is forfeited before the game 
even starts. Further, three races start with chaotic alignment. If the PC wants to 
receive Healing from Jharod, thus avoiding Kranf Niest's stat drains, alignment must be 
changed to neutral (or lawful).

Note also that no race starts with Herbalism, the other skill available through a 
Terinyo quest. If the player wants maximum flexibility - to do either Rynt's or 
Guth'Alak's quest, or neither (in the case of a minimalist challenge game) - choose a 
class that starts with Healing, Herbalism, or ideally both, such as a Beastfighter, 
Druid, Healer, Priest, Ranger or Wizard.

If there is a skill that is difficult to obtain that you cannot live without, such as 
Alertness, play a dark elf or drakeling, or choose a class that is born with it - 
Archers, Healers, Monks, Rangers and Thieves all start with this skill. Many players 
feel similarly about Detect Item Status - play Priests or a Merchant for a challenge.

A PC that trains a given skill due to both race and class will be especially proficient 
with that skill. This makes certain combinations especially powerful. Dwarven 
Weaponsmiths (doubly trained Metallurgy and Smithing), Hurthling Archers (doubly trained 
Archery), Hurthling Farmers (doubly trained Archery, Cooking, Food Preservation, 
Gardening, Stealth) and Dark Elven Rangers (doubly trained Alertness and Climbing) are 
examples.

The ADOM manual gives some hints about race/class combinations. For instance, the manual 
identifies trolls as the strongest, toughest and stupidest race in the game and suggests 
that they make good fighters (because of their strength and toughness) and lousy 
magicians (because of their low learning and mana). This is true as far as it goes, but 
trollish wizards can be a viable combination if they are played more as fighters to start 
and later develop their magical talents. Elves make fantastic wizards (due to their high 
learning and mana) once they gain some experience, but are difficult to keep alive in the 
early game because of their low toughness. Humans are a jack of all trades race and can 
be used with all classes. Some combinations favored by newsgroup readers:

Trollish beastfighters and barbarians - brute force fighters
Gnomish elementalists - magic users with more toughness than elves
Elven archers - natural talent with bows
Elven wizards - high mana and learning
Dwarven weaponsmiths - natural smithing talent
Hurthling archers - natural talent with thrown rocks

Classes and combinations that are regarded as difficult:

Farmers
Merchants, especially dark elven merchants because of their low charisma and toughness
Necromancers in general are very difficult to keep alive at low levels

0.1.3 Special considerations

Dark Elves - Dark Elves receive very low offers and high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown 
shop.  Dark Elven Necromancers are very Chaotic.  It takes some work to get them to Neutral 
alignment to receive Healing from Jharod, for instance, if that is desired.  Dark elves are 
unique in that spider corpses are nutritious for them.  Poison resistance can still be gained 
from spider corpses.

Drakelings - Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF (see section 2.19) and D: 49 (see 
section 3.12).  Drakelings who are unlucky enough to find a greater white dragon vault will 
also face speed problems.

Druids - All Druids start at some flavor of neutral alignment.

Elves - All elves, High, Gray, or Dark, have very long lifespans.  This is worth considering 
since several of the high level monsters encountered in ADOM have an aging attack.  Ghost 
Lords, for instance, may well age a human, dwarf or troll to death in one or two hits, since 
these PCs have a life span of 100 years or so at most.  Elven PCs do not need to worry about 
this, since they live for at least 1000 years.  In gammas before 1.0.0, elven lifespans as 
long as 3500 years have been observed.  The upper limit is not known in ADOM 1.0.0.  Balancing 
this is the fact that they are more fragile than other races in terms of toughness in the 
early game.

Gnomes - Gnomes require only 3/4 the number of missile weapon marks to advance their 
crossbow skill level relative to other races.

Hurthlings - Hurthlings start the game with the Thrown Rocks missile weapon skill at level 
four.  They also start the game wearing a cursed ring, unfortunately.  Hurthlings also have a 
racial dislike for shoes, which causes a loss of dexterity when Hurthlings don footwear in 
ADOM.  Hurthlings also have an advantage over other races when training the slings and thrown 
rocks missile weapon skills: they require only two thirds of the marks other races do in order 
to advance a skill level.

Merchants - Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings, scrolls, or wands.  
This specialization allows them to identify any item in that category on sight.  Merchants 
have the ability to use thrown gold pieces as effective missiles.  Dopplegangers are not able 
to deflect gold pieces thrown by merchants.  This is the only known way to attack dopplegangers 
with missiles.

Trolls - Trolls advance in experience level very slowly relative to other races.  Trolls start 
the game with the Twohanded Weapons melee skill at level two.  Do not pay any attention to this 
if you are playing a trollish beastfighter.  Drop that club and fight unarmed.

0.2 Alignment and Altars


0.2.1 What is alignment?

Alignment reflects the moral nature of the PC. For example, PCs with lawful alignment 
generally do not slaughter innocents or steal from shops. Chaotic PCs will do these 
things and a lot worse besides. Neutral PCs choose from both options, doing nasty things 
when necessary to further their cause, but also performing good acts to maintain their 
balanced alignment.

A general and quite complete description of alignment can be found in the ADOM manual. 
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with that description. The effects alignment 
have on gameplay are discussed here. The effects are mostly evident to the player in 
terms of the quests and rewards that are available.

Quests, rewards and alignment restrictions:

Terinyo - quests are available to all PCs regardless of alignment, however Guth'Alak 
          will not reward chaotics with a potion of cure corruption for delivering a 
          chaos creature's corpse
Jharod - will not teach the Healing skill to chaotics, regardless of how Yrrigs is 
         dealt with
Hotzenplotz - quests are available regardless of alignment
Yergius - will not teach the Pick Pockets skill, or anything else, to lawfuls
Old Barbarian - will not give the Courage quest to chaotics
Unicorn quest - Yrruir will not give the quest to kill Riurry to chaotics.  
                There is some uncertainty/argument about this
Thrundarr - all quests are available regardless of alignment
Dwarven Mystic - rewards are dependent on alignment; chaotics will receive nothing 
                 from him
Kherab - quests are available regardless of alignment
Demented Ratling - assigns a quest only to chaotics
Gaab'Baay - assigns her quests to chaotics only
Assassin Prince - Filk quest is available regardless of alignment
Sharad-Waador - quest to kill Srraxxarrakex is available regardless of alignment
Mad Minstrel - reveals the location of the scintillating cave regardless of alignment
Khelavaster - will not summon the Trident of the Red Rooster for chaotics


0.2.2 Changing alignment

Changing alignment can be done in several ways.  It is easy to change from a lawful flavor 
of alignment to a chaotic one.  The PC need only commit chaotic acts, which include attacking 
non-hostile monsters, reading tracts of chaos, wearing an amulet of chaos, pickpocketing and 
eating undead corpses.  Attacking monsters with a weapon of vampirism or wearing armor of 
chaos will also move alignment towards chaotic in ADOM 1.0.0+.  Changing from chaotic towards 
neutrality and law is more difficult.  A blessed amulet of order, available from Tywat Pare, 
is helpful for this.  Completing lawful quests will move the PC's alignment towards law.  
Examples include the puppy quest, the Yrrigs quest, the Keethrax quest, Tywat Pare's and 
Thrundarr's quests.  Giving food or gold to beggars and seeds to farmers is lawful.  Healing 
the PC's pet (only when actually injured) is a lawful act.  Self-flagellation, using a whip 
in the tool slot, moves alignment towards lawful.  Wearing armor of order draws the PC's 
alignment towards lawful in ADOM 1.0.0+.

All of the above are gradual methods which take some time to accomplish an alignment change.  
Without question, the fastest and easiest way to change alignment is by making sacrifices on 
an altar.  See the section below about altars for more alignment change strategy.


0.2.3 Altars - How to use altars.

The main thing you do on altars is sacrificing (or 'O'ffering). Things that can be 
sacrificed include items, monsters and gold. When sacrificing items, you stand on top of 
the altar and 'O'ffer the item, which will then be accepted or rejected by the deity. 
When sacrificing monsters, you stand away from the altar, wait for the monster to step 
onto the altar, and then 'O'ffer it. Note that most humanoid monsters have the ability 
to speak. This means they can sacrifice the PC. Most, but not all, humanoids are chaotic. 
So idly standing around on an altar, especially a chaotic one, near humanoid enemies is 
a very unwise thing to do.

When sacrificing items, one might want to keep in mind the fact that some races' deities 
specially favor some item types. These can be found in the manual and are listed here for 
reference:

Humans: tools of all kind
Trolls: rocks, the larger the better
Hurthlings: cooked meals
Gnomes: gems
Dwarves: gold
High Elves and Gray Elves: magical rings
Dark Elves: magical wands and books
Orcs: melee weapons
Drakelings: musical instruments

Sacrificing monsters can be very bountiful, especially on levels with a high monster 
generation rate. There are a few things to be remembered, though:

Lawful and neutral gods don't like it when you sac "their beings", i.e. neutral beings 
to a neutral god or lawfuls to a lawful god. Chaotics don't care.

Bred, summoned, undead and unlife beings can not be sacrificed.

On any coaligned altar, you can detect your items' status by simply dropping the stuff on 
the altar regardless of piety level. Furthermore, when any offering has been accepted, 
you'll notice your standing with your deity. The effects are:

"MORTAL, YE HAVE PESTERED ME FOR TOO LONG!" - summons solars/spectres/greater daemons
"Mortal, ye art a pest."                    - A bolt of -damage type- hits you! 
"*I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal"       - equipment turned to dust
"You feel bad... very bad."                 - same piety level as above, dooming results 
                                              if no equipment
"Take this for ye impunity!"                - inventory cursed
"Mortal, you are a nuisance!"
You hear -deity- grumbling in anger.
For some seconds the ground rumbles. Nothing else happens.
-deity- seems to be unconcerned.
-deity- seems to be pleased.
-deity- seems to be very pleased with you.   - deity will bless water dropped on altar
You feel inner strength lifting you spirits. - same piety level as inner peace, deity 
                                               grants the Lucky intrinsic, occurs only if 
                                               the PC didn't have the Lucky intrinsic
You feel inner peace.                        - see above message about inner strength
You burn with the anticipation of power      - chaotic equivalent of inner peace
You feel spiritually invincible.
You feel very close to -deity-               - deity removes Cursed/Doomed intrinsics if 
                                               present ("You feel a terrible gloom being 
                                               lifted from you"), grants Fate Smiles 
                                               intrinsic
You feel extremely close to -deity-          - (pre/post)crowning possibility
-deity- seems to be absolutely close to you  - the PC is eligible for crowning: correct 
                                               alignment and the highest level of piety

Another message occurs only under the following circumstances: if a PC sacrifices 
enough to get to the spiritually invincible state in one turn, having neither the 
Lucky nor Fate Smiles intrinsics, the message "You feel spiritually elated!" is 
generated and the PC receives the Lucky and Fate Smiles intrinsics simultaneously.  
This works regardless of alignment.  There may be more details to be worked out 
concerning this regarding possession of the Cursed and/or Doomed intrinsics.

Other messages are generated when sacrificing under special circumstances 
(generally when the PC has offended his deity):

"*MORTAL, I AM NOT BUILDING A BLOODY GARDEN UP HERE! NO MORE TREES! }*" - the 
PC tried to sacrifice an animated tree; there is a typo, apparently, the }

A voice in your mind lectures you. "*WHAT A MEDIOCRE SIGN OF DEVOTION. IMPROVE!*" 
- the PC tried to sacrifice summoned creatures

You hear a booming voice in your mind...  "*BE WARNED! SACRIFICING MY OWN 
CREATURES IS NOT SOMETHING I WELCOME WITH JOY!*" - the PC tried to sacrifice 
a creature coaligned with the altar

-deity- booms: "*YOU DARE TO SACRIFICE MY GIFTS AT MY HOLY PLACE?!?*  "*FOOL!*" 
The -foo- is consumed by a -bar- light and disappears. - the PC sacrificed a 
divine gift

Suddenly -deity- speaks to you.  *YOU DARE TO OFFER THE CRAP SOLD BY RATLING TRADERS?*  
*FORGET IT!*  The -ratling fodder- disappears.

Messages when sacrificing in the dark:

"You feel a warm aura." - a lawful altar
"The air is suddenly very moist." - a neutral altar
"You suddenly feel a chilling cold." - a chaotic altar

These messages are generated regardless of piety. The piety messages follow these. 
Note that creatures cannot be sacrificed in the dark.

Sacrificing items, gold or monsters on an altar can change the alignment of the PC or 
the alignment of the altar. Note, however, that sacrificing at a lawful altar will not 
move a PCs alignment all the way to L+.  Likewise, sacrificing at a chaotic altar will 
not move a PCs alignment all the way to C-.  To achieve these alignments, the PC has to 
commit other lawful or chaotic acts, respectively (or wear an amulet corresponding to 
the desired alignment, preferably blessed).  In general, small sacrifices move the 
alignment of the PC towards the alignment of the altar. Large sacrifices move the 
alignment of the altar towards that of the PC. Live sacrifices can fall into either 
category depending on the experience level of the PC and the level of the monster being 
sacrificed. Converting the alignment of a PC or an altar with live sacrifices is a 
somewhat tricky and complicated business and can have dire consequences if the 
sacrificing is done incorrectly. Using gold is much more straightforward. To move a PC's 
alignment towards that of an altar, sacrifice small amounts of gold, 10 or 20 pieces, 
repeatedly. This will eventually result in a message: "*WELCOME BELIEVER*" when the PC's 
alignment changes to that of the altar. An additional message, "You feel your morals 
changing." occurs when changing from lawful to neutral on a chaotic altar or from chaotic 
to neutral on a lawful altar.  The exception to this easy alignment conversion is the case 
of highly experienced chaotic PCs. More about that special case is found in section 4.3, 
ultra endings. To change the alignment of an altar to match the PC's, sacrifice at least 
3000 gold at one time. The 3000 figure is a minimum; more may be required depending on 
the PC's experience level.

Some observations about sacrificing on nonaligned altars and changing the alignment of 
altars with live sacrifices: 

Druids should be very careful to avoid sacrificing animals at any time.

Lawful gods do not like having lawful creatures sacrificed; neutral gods do not like 
having neutral creatures sacrificed; chaotic gods are indifferent. This makes the 
situation simplest for chaotic PCs. They can sacrifice anything on chaotic altars with 
no fear of alignment change. This also means the situation is at a dead end: chaotic 
PC + chaotic altar means no alignment change is possible.

Any time a PC sacrifices at a nonaligned altar, *two* gods are involved: the PC's god, 
who may accept a large enough sacrifice and fight the nonaligned god for control of the 
altar, and the nonaligned god, who may accept small sacrifices from the PC and move the 
PCs alignment towards that of the altar. This also means there are two gods who may 
object to live sacrifices. It is always unwise to sacrifice creatures of the PC's 
alignment or the altar's alignment. The exception is chaotic PCs sacrificing at chaotic 
altars as described above.

The fact that two deities are involved when sacrificing on a nonaligned altar means a 
puzzling phenomenon may occur when sacrificing your race's god's preferred items on a 
nonaligned altar. The PC's deity may be able to accept the sacrifice and "deeply 
appreciate" it while simutaneously the nonaligned deity is angered by the fact that a 
nonaligned PC used the altar. Depending on the PC's piety relationship with the 
nonaligned god (it is possible to have a piety relationship with more than one god), this 
may result in a "deeply appreciates" message as well as a negative effect such as 
inventory cursing or destruction.

A live sacrifice at a nonaligned altar behaves similarly to non-live sacrifices in that 
small sacrifices move the PC toward the alignment of the altar while large ones move the 
altar to the PC's alignment, but it is much more difficult to predict exactly what will 
happen. There are many factors involved: the PC's experience level, crowned vs uncrowned 
status, piety relationship with both the PC's god and the nonaligned god as well as the 
experience level of the monster being sacrificed. A goblin is considered a large 
sacrifice for a level one PC but small for a level ten PC. It is very difficult to 
predict exactly what will happen in borderline cases. After reaching experience level 
five or so, it becomes very risky to attempt an altar conversion using a low level live 
sacrifice such as an orc or goblin. The god's standards are higher than that by this 
point.

If the PC angers a god by sacrificing one of his creatures, several negative consequences 
may result. For example, if a PC sacrifices a creature of his own alignment his god 
responds with: "*BE WARNED! SACRIFICING MY OWN CREATURES IS NOT SOMETHING I WELCOME WITH 
JOY!*" Repeating this act results in: "*YOU DARE TO SACRIFICE ONE OF MY CREATURES?* 
*DEFILER*" This may be followed by: "-deity- luckily seems unconcerned." depending on the 
PC's piety level. Repeating again results in the same two messages followed by conversion 
of a neutral altar to chaotic. This example was done with a neutral PC, exp lvl 5, 
sacrificing neutrals on a neutral altar which became chaotic. The PC did not gain the 
cursed or doomed intrinsics, nor did his alignment change.

A second example: a chaotic PC sacrificing neutral creatures on a neutral altar: First: 
"*YOU DARE TO SACRIFICE ONE OF MY CREATURES?* *DEFILER* You suddenly hear a thundering 
voice. *I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal. Your equipment turns to dust." Next: "*I* 
hereby punish thee, puny mortal! You barely notice some thoughts: I can't believe it!" 
The second message here is because the PC was wearing artifacts and artifacts only. The 
PC did not gain the cursed or doomed intrinsics. If the PC had been wearing any 
non-artifact equipment, it would have been destroyed. If the PC wore nothing, he gained 
the doomed, and not the cursed, intrinsic.

The implication of the above paragraph should be obvious: Wear ARTIFACTS AND ARTIFACTS 
ONLY when attempting to convert an altar. Wield a si if necessary. This completely avoids 
the equipment destruction and dooming penalties.

It is not clear exactly what the criteria are for inventory cursing versus equipment 
destruction (turned to dust) versus dooming versus bolts versus summoning. Dooming should 
only occur when the offended god wants to destroy the PC's equipment when the PC is 
wearing no equipment. Once again, it seems to depend on the PC's experience level, 
crowned vs uncrowned status, general piety level with respect to his god and possibly 
the nonaligned god as well. There has been a report of immediately being blasted with a 
bolt of True Matter when unsuccessfully attempting to convert a neutral altar with a 
Champion of Law on D: 45, for instance.

The chart below shows all of the possible combinations for PCs sacrificing live monsters 
on aligned and nonaligned altars. The "altar moves to" field *assumes the sacrifice is 
successful*. A dash means there is no change in the altar; these are the "proper" 
sacrifices a PC makes in order to gain piety and move towards the extreme of his 
alignment. The "god irritated" field is as follows: Yes means the PC's god is irritated 
- a lawful PC tried to sacrifice a lawful creature or a neutral PC tried to sacrifice a 
neutral creature. No means the sacrifice was proper, the god accepted the sacrifice, the 
PC gains piety and moves closer to the extreme of his alignment. Fight means the original 
god who owned the altar fights, and loses every time, to the god taking possession of it. 
Note that the changes are stepwise: a lawful PC first changes a chaotic altar to neutral 
then to lawful.

How the PC's alignment or piety level changes when converting altars is not proven for 
all cases. Note the case of a neutral sacrificing neutrals on a neutral altar. It is 
correct as written. The altar moves to chaotic with no (or a very, very small) alignment 
change or other negative consequences to the PC. Also note the remarkable case of neutral 
PCs sacrificing neutral monsters on a chaotic altar. This converts the altar to neutral 
with no noticeable alignment change. Lawfuls sacrificing lawfuls on a lawful altar may 
convert the altar to neutral, but not always. The PC always receives a noticeable 
alignment drop.

This chart will be updated as research progresses.

Note that only champions of Neutrality or Order can convert the altars in the elemental 
temples.

If all of this has confused more than it has helped, here are some rules of thumb:

1) DO NOT sacrifice a creature whose alignment is the same as the PC's or the altar's. 
If you need to take advantage of live sacrifices to increase piety, only sacrifice 
nonaligned monsters on an aligned altar.

2) If you must convert an altar, do it with gold. It is much, much safer.


0.2.4 Recovering from errors.

Precautions:

When converting an altar, remove all gear except for artifacts. Also, remember that the 
bigger your sacrifice, the more likely it is that the altar converts - but remember, this 
sacrifice probably has minimal effect on piety, so don't make it ridiculously huge.

Dropping items on a nonaligned altar will make the deity that owns the altar angry. 
This causes some warning messages along the lines of "GET YOUR JUNK OFF MY ALTAR." 
Ordinarily this should be enough warning. If an extended drop command is used, however, 
there seems to be a bug present that allows the dropping to continue until the angry 
deity curses the inventory of the PC. Watch out for this.

If things go wrong:

1) Inventory cursed

By the time you have enough valuable stuff to sacrifice, you should be able to uncurse 
a cursed inventory with little trouble. Get to an aligned altar immediately. Bless your 
potions of water by dropping them on the altar if you are in sufficient standing with 
your deity. If not, sacrifice gold until you are. Dip a scroll of uncursing into your 
new holy water, read it, and voila, all of your stuff is back to uncursed status. 
Obviously, previously blessed status of inventory items has been lost.

2) Equipment turned to dust

This is why it's always recommended to remove non-artifacts before converting altars 
- you don't want to lose those seven league boots or that nifty sword of sharpness, 
do you?

3) Doomed

If the PC had no equipment, dooming rather than equipment turned to dust will occur. 
This is why the PC should have *some* equipment worn, even a si. It will be necessary 
to sacrifice enough to get your piety all the way up to very close, at which time the 
dooming will be removed. It is handy to know how to remove dooming and cursing in any 
case, since these intrinsics can be caused by things other than mistakes with altars 
- robbing shops with lawfuls, attacking karmics in melee and pools spring to mind.

4) The worst two - bolt and summoning

Ordinarily these never occur when mistakes with altars are made. It takes dooming then 
repeated additional prayers for a deity to get this mad. However, there are two 
situations where this will happen *immediately* - falling from champion status and 
sacrificing a gift from your deity. The deity casts an energy bolt at the PC, which, 
strangely enough, the PC seems to be immune to more often than not. The deity is further 
incensed by this and says "DAMN, YOU'LL SUFFER FOR THIS HUMILIATION TOO!" and summons 
creatures dependent on the deity: lawful deity - solars, neutral deity - spectres, 
chaotic diety - greater daemons. The exact sequence of events is dependent upon what 
the PC is doing, praying repeatedly while doomed or falling from champion staus. In the 
former case there may be additional monsters summoned prior to those listed above.

Another case which causes summoning is to get as far as possible from a particular god 
then sacrifice on that god's altar. For instance, if an initially chaotic PC sacrifices 
repeatedly on a neutral altar to achieve very good standing with the neutral god then 
sacrifices on a lawful altar, creatures may be summoned.


0.2.5 Crowning, precrowning and postcrowning

Pre- and postcrowning gives you a random artifact, which will be one of the 
non-guaranteed artifacts. The requirements for pre- and postcrowning are:

* precrowning occurs only if the PC is not of extreme alignment (not L+, N= or C-)
* extremely close
* character level >= 8 + 3 * artifacts generated.

Postcrowning doesn't include the non-extreme alignment restriction.

Note that PCs who achieve precrowning or crowning may never again see the "extremely 
close" status message. In this case, determining whether the PC has sufficient piety 
for further precrownings, crowning or postcrowning is a matter of trial and error. 
This is not as bad as it might seem, since praying uses up very little piety if prayers 
"remain unheard" - that is, the deity does nothing.

These seem to be the most important requirements in 1.0.0 - for instance, the PC may be 
wearing cursed items and the pre- or postcrowning will still occur.

For crowning, the PC must be at extreme alignment and extremely close (or have enough 
piety at very close). The PC must not be intrinsically Cursed or Doomed for any type of 
crowning. Ordinarily, this will never be a problem, since achieving very close status 
removes these intrinsics. However, if the PC is wearing or wielding an item that causes 
Cursing or Dooming (the Crown of Science, Executor, etc.), crowning will not occur. 
Upon crowning, you receive an immunity, an artifact crowning gift which is preselected 
from a list of appropriate items for your race and class (see section 0.2.4.1 below), a 
blessed amulet matching the PC's alignment, a permanent blessing, the ability to convert 
elemental altars for champions of Balance and Order, to wear artifacts and other food 
consumption adding items with less burden on your metabolism and to pray more often.

Note that the immunity received will not be one the PC already has, whether through 
eating appropriate corpses or worn items. For instance, if the PC is wearing the Ring of 
Immunity at crowning time, he will receive no immunity at all - take it off! Likewise, 
the Ancient Mummy Wrapping can be worn or the scorched spear wielded at crowning time to 
ensure the PC does not receive the rather undesirable immunity to cold.

The immunity you receive can be figured out by the message that it gives:

Acid: "You look forward to be digested by Chaos Lords / Lords of Order themselves."
Cold: "You feel prepared for the most chilling tasks."
Fire: "You no longer fear the heat of all hells combined."
Shock: "You feel that neither thunder nor lightning will be able to prevent the 
        success of your mission."

Getting pre- or post-crowned increases the piety required for further pre- or 
post-crownings.

As an example to show how this works quantitatively, Malte Helmert did the following 
research using gold as the sole sacrificial item:

> I made some experiments with a human druid (neutral), got WADOMF and hacked
> a copy of my binary especially for that guy. Went straight to dwarftown,
> don't remember the PC's level. Anyway, I made a series of checks to find out
> the lower bounds on money required. When a certain amount seemed sufficient
> to get to extremely close, I reloaded and tried again with 10,000 less to
> check if it is really minimal.
> 
> Results:
> First crowning took 100,000 gp
> First postcrowning took only 40,000 gp (!)
> Second postcrowning took 180,000 gp
> Third postcrowning took 500,000 gp
> Fourth postcrowning took 970,000 gp
> Fifth postcrowning took 1,600,000 gp.
> Didn't check further, what's the point anyway.
> 
> All postcrownings took place at extremely close, so I wondered if it is
> possible to be crowned/postcrowned at very close. It turned out that this

> seemed sufficient.
> 
> I also wondered whether there as a difference between saccing 100,000 in one
> go or in ten parts of 10,000 gp. It did not make any difference.
> 
> I then tried to measure the negative impact of praying before being able to
> get crowned (something you occasionally do when you think you should be able
> to get (pre-) crowned though still at very close). It was quite small: If
> I sacced 10,000, then prayed, sacced 10,000, then prayed, and so on, it took
> me 110,000 rather than 100,000 to get crowned. I suppose the cost of praying
> might be higher if your god actually does something, though. In my case the
> prayers simply remained unheard, since I was fully healed etc.
> 
> Last check was with "overflow". If I sac 200,000 rather than 100,000, do the
> extra 100,000 do me any good or is the piety reset to some fixed value after
> crowning? It turned out that you can safely sac more: It gets carried over.
> 
> I did not make quantitative checks, but saccing about 4,000,000 gp (don't
> remember exactly), then praying six times in a row gave me a crowning gift
> and five postcrowning gifts.
> 
> Don't really know if this matters, since by the time you have that money
> (casino and so on), you're normally no longer able to be pre/postcrowned,
> but maybe it's interesting to know all the same.


0.2.5.1 Possible crowning gifts for each class

Note that Dwarves of any class can receive Hammerhead as a crowning gift. Likewise, 
High Elves and Gray elves can receive Sun's Messenger as a crowning gift. This 
research was last verified in gamma 14 by Lee Morgan. In general, there are six 
possible gifts. There are exceptions: see Barbarian, Beastfighter, Mindcrafter, 
Paladin, Thief and Wizard.

Andrew Skalski provided the explanation for this. By examining the g16p2 executable, 
he determined that there are indeed less than six possible crowning gifts for these 
classes. However, the blank spots are filled in with a duplicate of one of the 
possibilities. This means that these classes are twice as likely to receive one of 
the doubled possibilities. The updated table below now reflects these observations. 
The order the artifacts are listed in is alphabetical and has no significance.

0.2.6 Piety loss

As referred to in the manual, a PC's piety level is determined by the sacrifices made 
to the PC's god. Remember that the value of sacrifices is dependent on a PC's race. 
Piety level constantly decreases with time, so sacrifices made in the early game will 
have little effect after many game turns have passed. In practice, this means that a 
PC who wants to keep his god happy should sacrifice items throughout the game. If a PC 
wants to be (pre- post- or normally) crowned, he should have a very large cache of 
valuable material to sacrifice. This can include live sacrifices, of course, which 
are always valuable.


0.3 Food - preventing starvation


Starvation is often a definite problem for new players. Rest assured that there is enough 
food provided in the game to survive. The easiest source at the start of the game is 
Munxip's food store in Terinyo. He sells primarily large rations, which are heavy at 
200 stones each. These can be useful for training the strength of PCs that start with low 
strength. Food will be found in the various dungeons available from quests assigned in 
Terinyo, and in all dungeons, for that matter. If the PC elects to take Tywat Pare's 
quest to find and kill Kranach and his gang in the wilderness, remember that wilderness 
square are big, take considerable game time to cross, and therefore require much more 
food per game turn than exploring in the dungeons.

Once the PC finishes the area around Terinyo, he will have to cross a large area of 
wilderness to reach the Caverns of Chaos, the main dungeon in the game. The same warning 
about food requirements in the wilderness applies. After reaching the Caverns of Chaos, a 
short descent to the Arena level will provide a very good food source. Ratling traders 
are found on this level, selling various comestibles. The best are cooked lizards. These 
are light at 3 stones each, fairly inexpensive and nutritious. Food problems are 
generally solved at this point.

Most of the corpses that monsters leave are edible. Some are to be avoided. Kobolds of 
any type cause sickness. Rats (simple rats, not giant rats) will make any race other 
than trolls or orcs vomit, but still increase satiation level slightly. Eating humanoid 
corpses, such as goblins, causes the message "This meal does not sit well with you." or 
"You feel uneasy." to be displayed. Several players have tested eating a variety of 
humanoid corpses while wearing the Platinum Girdle, which kills if a chaotic act is 
committed. It never killed the PCs.

Having said that, PC's who have trained the Law skill will receive the message "You feel 
as if transgressing some law." when eating a humanoid corpse, even a lowly goblin. 
However, there is no effect on alignment. This seems to imply that there is a bug 
somewhere in the humanoid corpse-eating code.

Bear in mind that Thomas himself has stated that eating humanoid corpses is not a 
chaotic act.

Dwarves refuse to eat dwarven corpses. They also refuse to eat orc corpses unless they 
are starving. 

Hurthlings refuse to eat black hurthling corpses.

Races other than trolls refuse to eat doppleganger corpses unless starving.

Be aware that some food items are susceptible to rotting. These include corpses of all 
types, apples and pieces of raw meat. Eating rotten food does not cause sickness or other 
negative effects. Food that starts to rot has actually become cursed and will soon 
disappear. Eat it quickly if possible. In the case of corpses, especially strategically 
important ones such as chaos creatures or quicklings, rotting may be indefinitely stopped 
by repeatedly dipping the corpse in holy water when necessary, thus blessing it. Cooked 
corpses decay more slowly than uncooked corpses. Cooked corpses can be created with the 
Cooking skill or by blasting them with fire, from the fire bolt spell, for instance. 
Blessed cooked corpses carried by PCs with Food Preservation at 100 never decay the most 
slowly. This is very handy for preserving the corpses of Chaos Orb guardians (see section 
0.10.2.1.1).

Wearing certain items causes a need for increased food consumption.  This includes all 
items that grant invisibility, artifacts (especially for PC's that are not crowned) and 
worst of all (since they grant no positive effect) amulets of hunger.  Interestingly, 
intrinsics, including intrinsic invisibility, do not have any effect on food consumption.  
Likewise, the Fate Smiles / Lucky / Cursed / Doomed intrinsics have no effect.

The level of satiation is displayed on the screen. High levels of satiation (satiated 
or bloated) will cause a speed decrease.

One type of herb, stomafillia, is extremely filling. Blessed stomafillia will cause 
a PC to be bloated immediately.

The satiation value of food items is increased by 25% for blessed items and decreased by
50% for cursed items.

More quantitative information about satiation levels produced by various food items is 
found in Appendix G Food - complete list.


0.4 Skills - description and usefulness


There is an excellent section in the ADOM manual on skills. Be sure to take advantage 
of it. Some additional tips are provided here. 

Alchemy            - One recipe is gained for each ten points in this skill.  The last 
                     recipe gained at skill level 100 is always for potions of gain 
                     attributes.  The keystroke shift-r brings up the recipe list.  
                     Ingredients can be potions and herbs.  The available recipes are 
                     always for: blindness, booze, cure poison, deafness, extra healing, 
                     gain attributes, insight, longevity, poison and youth.  The order 
                     is random except for gain attributes.
Alertness          - Very helpful for evading bolt spells and undiscovered traps.
Appraising         - Opinions vary.  Cursed items can be rated as good, a nasty surprise.
Archery            - Obvious benefits.
Athletics          - Nice +8 bonus to speed at 100.  Very powerful combination with 
                     Raven birthsign.
Backstabbing       - Very powerful when combined with invisibility.
Bridge Building    - If you must build a bridge it is obviously essential.
Climbing           - Manual omits the fact that this must be at 100 to enter the Rift.  
                     Training with Yergius makes this much easier to achieve.
Concentration      - Critical for wizards and necromancers.  Get this to 100 ASAP.
Cooking            - Useful for preserving the corpse of orb guardians.  
Courage            - Nice to have, some ignore it entirely when going for an ultra ending.
Detect Item Status - Nice but not necessary.
Detect Traps       - Very important unless you can recharge wands of trap detection 
                     indefinitely.  There are several heavily trapped areas in the game.  
                     Very useful for detecting trapped doors as well.  'A'pply this skill 
                     towards any door whose trapped vs untrapped status is unknown.
Disarm Traps       - Nowhere near as important as Detect Traps.  Once detected, traps 
                     are easily avoided.
Dodge              - Very nice DV +10 at skill level 100.
Find Weakness      - Very nice increase to critical hits.
First Aid          - All PCs have this.  Can restore (some) recently lost hit points, but 
                     perhaps more importantly, can be used every turn to fight sickness.  
                     This can be a life saver.  First Aid also works for poisoning.  
                     Apply the skill every time the game generates the message about 
                     "poison coursing through your veins!"
Fletchery          - Wait until skill level is high, ideally 100, to use it.
Food Preservation  - Important for all, essential for necromancers.
Gardening          - For farmers, of course.
Gemology           - Gems are found and some identified solely depending on this skill.  
                     Without it, gems will not be found when mining.  Exploitable.
Haggling           - Somewhat useful for all, essential for merchants.
Healing            - Very important for all PCs.  Get it if you aren't born with it.
Herbalism          - Very useful for all PCs.  Willpower, Toughness and Dexterity all go 
                     to ~25 with herbs.  All herbs picked without this skill will be cursed.
Law                - Marginal.  By the time this skill informs you of the criminal 
                     nature of some act, the PC has already committed it!  Does inform 
                     of lawful acts.
Listening          - All PCs have this.  High skill level may train perception.  Trains 
                     naturally, don't waste level advances on this.
Literacy           - Essential for spellcasters, most of whom are born with high levels 
                     anyway.  Less important than it used to be, since reading scrolls 
                     does not require high literacy.  
Metallurgy         - Essential for weaponsmiths.
Mining             - High level in Mining helps stop pickaxes from breaking.
Music              - Essential for bards, of course.  Very high levels are needed for 
                     good effectivity.
Necromancy         - Necromancers, of course.  Get this to 100 as soon as convenient.  
                     Do not believe the manual about very slow regeneration of mana.  
                     Using the skill trains the mana attribute.
Pick Locks         - Useful for thieves.  Must have thieves' picks.
Pick Pockets       - Useful for all.  Occasionally a truly outstanding object can be 
                     pickpocketed.  Proving the PC a successful pickpocket allows 
                     entrance to the Thieves Guild, a means to receive very useful 
                     training.
Smithing           - Useful for all PCs, the specialty of weaponsmiths.
Stealth            - Useful for all PCs.
Survival           - Useful for all PCs, especially trolls and rangers.  All PCs born in the 
                     month of he Falcon receive this.  Applying the skill while Bloated on a 
                     non-water square causes plant seeds to be gathered, which have some 
                     nutritional value and can be given to farmers for a small lawful boost.  
                     Doing the same on a water square causes fish to be gathered, which can 
                     be used to tame a variety of monsters (see Section 0.11.1.3).
Swimming           - Nearly essential for all PCs in later gammas and 1.0.0 that include 
                     rivers (at least those without a means of casting Frost Bolt).
Tactics            - Useful for all PCs, increases modifiers from the tactics settings.
Two Weapon Combat  - Useful for all PCs.  Two words:  Needle.  Sting.
Ventriloquism      - Opinions vary.  A means of confusing monsters.
Woodcraft          - Nearly essential if the PC is going to chop trees.


0.4.1 Guaranteed ways of acquiring skills

0.4.2 Non-guaranteed ways of acquiring skills

Potions of education can grant a new random skill or increase proficiency in an 
existing random skill. Skills can also be wished for; the exceptions are Alertness 
and Healing.

0.4.3 Training skills

In the sense meant for the sake of the following table, "training" means actions that will 
cause a skill to spontaneously increase, *without* the player deciding to increase skill 
proficiency when gaining an experience level. This is different from Yergius' training, 
which can change the potential maximum for a skill (how high the PC can raise it) and the 
dice roll (how fast the PC can get it there). The value of Yergius' training can only be 
taken advantage of when gaining an experience level or after successfully applying the skill 
elsewhere in the game.

0.5 Spells and Mindcraft

Spells - description and usefulness

There is a very good section on spells including damage and range in the ADOM manual. 
The diameter of ball spells is dependent upon Willpower / 8. However, this diameter 
only increases as a multiple of sixteen since ball spells radiate symmetrically; the 
minimum diameter is two.  Therefore getting Willpower to 24, for instance, does not 
increase the diameter.  Willpower must be increased to 32 for the diameter to increase 
to four, 48 for the diameter to increase to six, 64 for the diameter to increase to 
eight, etc.

Note that spells become more costly to cast (in terms of PP) as the number of 
available castings decreases. Thus a spell will increase in cost as the number 
of available castings decreases below 100 or so, becoming very noticeable as 
the number drops below about 20.  This is class dependent but will affect all 
classes to differing extents.  Note also that the number of available castings 
is not a simple "decrement by one each time the spell is cast" type of formula.  
Again depending on class, the difficulty of casting the spell and probably other 
factors this will vary.  For example, casting Light with 1000 castings available 
to a level 40 wizard may decrease the available castings by one, while casting 
Death Ray with 20 castings available with a level 30 archer may reduce the 
available castings to zero.  These are purely hypothetical examples but should 
give an idea of the trends.

Some general remarks about spells: Ball spells are extraordinarily useful since no 
monsters shrug them off. They are wonderful when the PC is surrounded, of course. It is 
worth switching to Coward tactics and waiting to be completely surrounded before casting. 
Since they are relatively costly in terms of PP, it is useful to destroy the maximum 
number of enemies with each casting. Fire magic is particularly effective against 
cold-based creatures and undead including mummies. Cold magic is particularly effective 
against fire-based creatures. Bless damages undead. Healing spells can be cast at 
monsters including companions (but don't use them on slaves!). Wish is a unique spell. 
It is very difficult to learn, probably impossible if the PC has teleportitis. Such PC's 
must travel to a location where teleportation is impossible, such as the the Assassin's 
Guild, the Tomb of the High Kings or the elemental temples (the desirability is in that 
order due to background corruption in all of those locations). Furthermore, PC's will 
usually reach Starving! status while attempting to learn Wish. Tactics to deal with this 
include eating a blessed stomfillia to become Bloated, waiting just until the PC returns 
to Satiated, then eating another blessed stomfillia. It may be necessary to drink 
additional satiating potions, such as potions of toughness or potential toughness, even 
when the double blessed stomafillia tactic is used. Alternatively, PC's without 
teleportitis can use a room that has the "rich flavour" special effect, where PC's will 
never become hungry. Wish is extraordinarly expensive to cast and also drains a random 
stat by -10 when cast. If the PC must cast it, be prepared for the stat drain. Plan to 
cast it in a special room that lowers spell costs, and on Silvernight or Darknight, if 
possible, according to the PC's alignment.

0.6 Stats

Stats are referred to as Attributes in the ADOM manual. A basic description of them can 
be found there. The current value for stats is displayed on the main game screen. The 
current value and the potential maximum value for the PC's stats can be found on the 
screen shown by the '@' command.

Stats can increase or decrease for many reasons, some of which are detailed below. When 
a stat changes, the following messages are generated:

                                       Stat changes

           Increases                       Stat                            Decreases

 Your muscles feel stronger              Strength                            Your muscles soften
 You feel studious                       Learning                  Thinking seems to get tougher
 Your will seems inflexible             Willpower                          You feel soft-hearted
 Your movements are getting swifter     Dexterity                          You are getting shaky
 Your health increases                  Toughness           It seems that you are getting a cold
 You feel very self-confident            Charisma                              You feel reserved
 Your looks improve                     Appearance                        You are growing a wart
 You feel more in touch with the world     Mana     You are getting out of touch with everything
 Your senses sharpen                    Perception               You seem to get less perceptive


0.6.1 Increasing stats

It is to any PC's advantage to raise stats to the potential maximum and beyond. There are 
several ways to do this. Stats may be increased to their potential maximum naturally by 
exercising the stat.


0.6.1.1 Exercising stats naturally

Examples of how to exercise stats naturally:

Strength - carrying around an inventory heavy enough to cause the PC to become Burdened 
           or Strained will exercise the Strength stat. The downside is that carrying 
           those heavy loads will make the PC slower. Being Strained and especially 
           Strained! for too long probably abuses the Dexterity stat.

Learning - reading scrolls and spellbooks trains Learning

Willpower - no known way to exercise naturally

Dexterity - no known way to exercise naturally

Toughness - Toughness increases probably occur faster if the PC is avoids Hungry and 
            Starving status

Charisma - no known way to exercise naturally

Appearance - no known way to exercise naturally

Mana - casting spells and creating undead slaves exercises the Mana stat

Perception - no known way to exercise naturally

Note that all physical (St, Dx, To) stat increases are liable to be faster when they are 
low and the PC is gaining experience levels relatively quickly. The Athletics skill also 
helps raise physical stats more quickly and has a small effect on Appearance.


0.6.1.2 Training with Garth

The dwarven weaponmaster Garth, found in Dwarftown, can be paid to increase stats other 
than Appearance and Mana. The formula for how much to pay is $100 * stat value, doubled 
once for each 5 points over 15. This is a general formula that may vary according to the 
PC's race.

See section 2.5.5 for a bit more detail on training with Garth.


0.6.1.3 Training stats with herbs

Two of the herbs can be used in order to increase stats to a maximum of about 25 (27 has 
been observed) per stat. These are:

Morgia root - toughness and willpower (eat)

Eating 2 morgia roots, any status, will train toughness. Eating 4 morgia roots, any 
status, will also train willpower. If the stats are already at their potential 
maximum, 8 morgia roots are required.  Eating more than 8 at once is a waste of morgia 
roots.

Moss of mareilon - dexterity (use)

Using 2 blessed or uncursed mosses of mareilon trains dexterity. If the dexterity stat 
is already at its potential maximum, 4 mosses of mareilon are required. Using more than 
4 at once is a waste of moss of mareilon.  Using cursed mosses of mareilon abuses the 
dexterity stat.

In any case, do not eat or use additional herbs until the stat increases have taken 
effect - this may take a while.  Note that training stats in this way is more 
effective when the stats are low.  Eating four morgia, for instance, may cause two or 
three increases in willpower and toughness if the stats are in the single digits.  
Once above ten, the stat increases seem to occur one point at a time.

As with training with Garth, there may be variations on this based on race.  
For instance, it seems that trolls always require double the dosages 
described above.


0.6.1.4 Increasing stats by eating corpses

Many corpses have an affect on stats. Some simply increase a given stat, others will 
increase one stat while decreasing another. Some have a limit, that is, they will only 
increase a stat to a certain number, after which they will have no effect. Others 
affect stats regardless of their value.

The effects will be compiled here eventually. Until then you can browse Appendix J 
for the effects resulting from eating monster corpses.


0.6.1.5 Increasing stats with potions

There are five kinds of potions that increase or decrease the PC's stats directly: 
potions of -stat-, potions of potential -stat-, potions of boost -stat-, potions of 
gain attributes and potions of carrot juice. Rearranging stats is dealt with below.

Potions of -stat- behave as follows:

uncursed potion of -stat-: an uncursed potion of -stat- will increase the value of 
                           -stat- by one, and increases the potential maximum plus one

blessed potion of -stat- : a blessed potion of -stat- will increase the value of -stat- 
                           by two, and increases the potential maximum plus two

cursed potion of -stat- : a cursed potion of -stat- will decrease the value of -stat- by 
                          one, and decreases the potential maximum by one

Potions of potential -stat- do the same with your stat potential, which determines the 
natural maximum of your PC in that stat.

Potions of boost -stat- work like potions of -stat-, but give a bigger boost that
is *temporary*. These are useful when you need to get some stat over a certain
limit, such as the Wi: 32 border that allows for bigger ball spells.  Another useful 
application is to use potions of boost learning just before a level increase, which 
will probably boost learning enough to increase the number of skill increases 
allowed. 

Potions of gain attributes raise the value of a single stat by one if uncursed or all 
stats by one if blessed. Note that they do not raise potential maximums. They only 
increase potential maximums to the resulting value of -stat-, when necessary.

Potions of carrot juice can be used to increase Perception. Drinking a blessed potion of 
carrot juice will increase Perception by +1. Drinking an uncursed potion of carrot juice 
may increase Perception if the Pe score is very low; this needs to be tested. There is a 
special room effect "The air of this room is filled with the smell of carrots." which 
will cause a one-time +5 increase to Perception when a blessed or uncursed potion of 
carrot juice is consumed while in the room.


0.6.1.6 Crystals of knowledge

'U'sing crystals of knowledge has two possible effects: if the crystal is 
uncursed, a bit of the level layout around the PC is revealed.  If the 
crystal is blessed, a +1 (sometimes +2) increase to the Learning stat also 
occurs.  In ADOM 1.0.0+, there is a limit similar to that encountered with 
herbs: Learning cannot be increased beyond 25 - 27 or so with blessed crystals 
of knowledge.


0.6.2 Rearranging stats


0.6.2.1 Potions of exchange

Drinking a potion of exchange changes your stats, not taking into account any effects 
from corruption or equipment. A cursed potion of exchange swaps six stats randomly, 
an uncursed one twists five, and a blessed one swaps two stats around.

0.6.2.2 Potions of balance

Potions of balance can be very, very helpful if you know how to use them. When you drink 
one, the game calculates the average of all of your stats, rounds it down, and adds a 
number depending on the potion's status. For a blessed potion, it's +3, uncursed 0, and 
cursed -3. The stat changes are based on this final score.

If a stat exceeds this score, it's lowered by one. If it's below this, it's raised by 
one. If it's equal, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, if you have a well-rounded character, with most or all stat scores close to 
each other and drink a blessed potion of balance, you will get a boost to most or all 
stats.

Potions of balance have a limit analgous to herbs in ADOM 1.0.0+: stats cannot 
be increased over ~25 using potions of balance.  There is also another effect 
in ADOM 1.0.0+: alignment moves towards neutrality when drinking a potion of 
balance.

Note also that potions of balance take into account all stat-modifying elements including 
worn equipment, wielded equipment and corruptions.


0.7 Weapon skills


A general description of weapon skills can be found in the ADOM manual.

In general, a PC with higher Strength will do more damage with a given weapon. There 
seems to be one important exception to this: whips. As implemented in ADOM, the damage 
done with whips, especially dual-wielded whips, seems to be more dependent on Dexterity 
than Strength. The manual touches on this subject, stating that a PC must have high 
speed to use two whips effectively. Dexterity seems to be at least as important.


0.7.1 Jack of all trades or master of one?

This is a matter of personal preference and style. The advantage of becoming very 
proficient with one weapon becomes clear from reading the manual: bonuses to the to-hit 
and to-damage as well as reduced attack cost when using the weapon. There is also the 
possibility of achieving Grand Mastery, where the attack cost is reduced to the point 
where about 1 1/2 attacks per round is possible. The downside is also easy to imagine: 
without an artifact weapon in the specialized category, a PC can have the weapon 
destroyed and be without one. In practice this is not usually a problem since there are 
generally plenty of weapons to be found in the game. Also, a PC may run across a truly 
outstanding weapon at some point in the game, some of which are guaranteed, and have no 
skill with the weapon. Again, this is not usually a huge problem since mid- to high-level 
PC's will be able to train up their weapon skill in any given category relatively quickly.


0.7.2 Class considerations - what weapon to specialize in

Beastfighters - Beastfighters receive severe penalties for using melee weapons, and 
                should avoid doing so for this reason. They develop a formidable unarmed 
                attack as they advance in experience and Unarmed Combat skill. Note that 
                the penalty does not apply to missile weapons; all beastfighters should 
                practice with missile weapons in order to take advantage of -foo- slaying 
                ammunition.

Mindcrafters - Willpower is critical for Mindcrafters. The Sword of Nonnak is a 
               guaranteed artifact sword available to most PCs at experience level 15 or 
               less. It grants +5 to Willpower. This makes Swords an attractive weapon 
               class for Mindcrafters to specialize in, at least during the early game.

Monks - Monks also receive penalties for using weapons, albeit not as severe as 
        Beastfighters, and so should specialize in Unarmed Combat. Monks also excel at 
        kicking and receive a class power that enables them to deliver a circular kick.


0.7.3 Achieving Grand Mastery

Grand Mastery is difficult to achieve. It will not happen simply from using a single 
weapon type throughout a normal game. Becoming doomed in the wilderness for the frequent 
wilderness encounters is one way of generating an infinite number of enemies to be killed 
with no corruption. The Crown of Science (doubly useful because of its +9 bonus to Le) or 
a ring of doom can be used for this.

There is one class + starsign combination that can reasonably expect to achieve Grand 
Mastery during a normal game. Note the following two manual entries:

From the Weapon Skills section:

Farmers are so skilled in the use of polearms that they need 20% less marks to increase 
in their use.

From the Horoscope section:

Sword
*****
Positive modifiers from Tactics settings are increased by 10%, costs to increase melee 
weapon skills are reduced by 20%, +1 to the initial Learning score.

This double 20% reduction in cost to increase weapon skills means that farmers born in the 
month of the Sword who use polearms exclusively, and do not hurry, can expect to achieve 
Grand Mastery with polearms. This will happen approximately by the time the PC reaches the 
Mana Temple, depending on the ending the PC is going for, etc.


0.8 Armor considerations


0.8.1 DV versus PV

As everyone knows for reading the ADOM manual, DV is an abbreviation 
for Defensive Value and PV is an abbreviation for Protection Value.  
The former determines how hard it is for an opponent to hit the PC; 
the latter determines how much damage is absorbed by a PC's armor if 
a monster makes a successful hit.  In recent gammas of ADOM, there 
has been a tendency for monsters to score more critical hits which 
bypass PV.  Some monsters *always* bypass PV, notably claw bugs, 
which make them very annoying opponents for low level characters.  
Note also that non-artifact armor can be damaged by monster attacks, 
lowering its Protection Value especially and eventually destroying it.

So the question arises, which is better, a high DV or a high PV?  
As with the question of whether to specialize in one weapon or become 
proficient with many weapons, it is largely a matter of personal 
preference and style.  There are successful players who use both 
approaches.  In practice, it is possible to raise DV to the point 
where none other than the very highest level monsters can hit the PC.  
A DV over 100 means very few monsters will hit the PC successfully.  
However, a DV this high is not available to any but the very high 
level characters that specifically pursue it.  Likewise, a PV over 
100 means few monsters can hurt the PC, since the vast majority do 
not deal over 100 points of damage in one round.  Bear in mind, 
however: 1) the possibility of critical hits and 2) the possibility 
of running into something very nasty, such as balors, Greater Molochs 
and the Emperor Moloch which certainly *do* deal over 100 points of 
damage per round.

A general rule of thumb?  Add up the DV and PV bonuses.  A [-3, +5] 
iron chain mail is about as good as a [+0, +2] leather armor (and the 
latter is lighter and won't rust).  Few non-artifact armors can compete 
with an average eternium plate mail at [-1, +13].  Dragon scale mails 
averaging [-2, +11] are also extremely desirable armors since they 
grant immunity to the element corresponding to the dragon the armor is 
derived from.  On the DV side, few non-artifact items can compare to 
eternium tower shields averaging [+16, +6].  Dragon scale mails and 
eternium tower shields are so powerful that many players will use a 
wish on these items.

The debate over DV versus PV is one that will never be settled, which 
is as it should be.  ;-)


0.9 Killing monsters


0.9.1 The significance of the first kill

Many new ADOM players are dismayed to find that they need to know what monster their 
PC killed first. By the time they find this out, they have forgotten, of course. Write 
it down, rename your PC to reflect your first kill, do anything necessary to remember 
that first kill. It is very important, especially if you are going to attempt an ultra 
ending.


0.9.1.1 The Courage skill

There is a description of the Courage skill in the ADOM manual. It is worthwhile to 
acquire it, although many players ignore it and have finished the game without it. The 
skill is obtained by finishing the Old Barbarian's quest: kill an additional score (20) 
of the monster your PC first killed. Note that the Old Barbarian will not give the quest 
to PCs who have chaotic alignment.


0.9.1.2 The Filk quest

The Filk quest is for very advanced players attempting an ultra ending. The quest 
objective is to find and kill the named quickling bard Filk. He can be found in the 
Infinite Dungeon on the level number corresponding to the number of first-kill monsters 
the PC has killed. This will of course be a minimum of 21 if the PC has acquired the 
Courage skill. It can also change during the quest if the PC kills additional first-kill 
monsters after being assigned the quest. See section 4.3.1.1 for more about the Filk 
quest.


0.9.1.3 Strategy for the first kill: where and what?

There are many schools of thought on what the first kill should be. If the PC wants to 
acquire the Courage skill quickly after being assigned the Old Barbarian's quest, the 
monsters should be readily available. If the PC also plans to do the Filk quest later in 
the game, the total number of first-killed monsters killed must be minimized in order to 
prevent a tedious and dangerous dive into the Infinite Dungeon. Some experienced players 
will ignore the Old Barbarian's quest for the Courage skill. This makes it very easy to 
complete the Filk quest, since if the player has chosen wisely the PC will have killed 
only one of the monsters in question. Some players choose to make the first kill in 
Lawenilothehl for this reason. Muggers, for instance, are found only in Lawenilothehl and 
the Assassins' Guild. Skriek, the ratling found in Lawenilothehl, is the only cloaked 
ratling in the game (although killing him means the PC can no longer buy keys from him, 
which can save the PC's life). Hotzenplotz, who is also located in Lawenilothehl, is the 
only crime lord in the game. He is not easy for an experience level one PC to kill, but 
it can be done with wizards who have a good offensive bolt spell (not Magic Missile), or 
hurthling archers who start the game with level five skill in thrown rocks. Hotzenplotz's 
guardians Grunge and Munge are likewise the only two half-orc bouncers in the game.

If the PC wants the Courage skill and wants to attempt an ultra ending, the following 
requirements must be met: the first kill must be a monster readily available after 
receiving the Old Barbarian's quest; it must also be uncommon in the various dungeons 
the PC will face so that the Filk quest does not get out of control. Entering the Small 
Cave at the start of the game and killing a rat, kobold or goblin as the first kill, for 
instance, makes it much more difficult to finish an ultra ending.


0.9.2 Cats - the significance of felines

There are three types of monsters that count as cats in ADOM: cave lions, cave tigers 
and wild cats.

The Cat Lord resides on D: 35 in the Caverns of Chaos.  He rewards PCs who have 
avoided killing any cats with a powerful artifact ring.  He will be hostile 
towards PCs that have killed cats and becomes more powerful with each cat killed. 

Many players consider the Ring of the Master Cat to be the most powerful and desirable 
ring in the game. It grants +16 to Dexterity and +16 to speed. In addition it causes the 
PC to deliver considerably more critical hits with melee and missile weapons and grants 
the Fate Smiles intrinsic.

It is important to remember that even after receiving the ring, the PC must not kill any 
cats while wearing it, since it explodes in that circumstance.  The ring does not explode 
if it is in the backpack or left on another level when a cat is killed after receiving 
the RotMC.

Make no mistake about it, the requirement to kill no cats for the entire game is a 
difficult one, causing many to refer to them as "those damn cats." The power of the ring 
makes it worthwhile to attempt to avoid killing them.

There are several ways to deal with cats.  Teleportation is one, from a wand or spell.  
Either teleport the cat away, especially if the PC does not have teleport control, or 
teleport the PC.  Potions of exchange thrown at a cat will turn it into another monster.  
Potions of raw chaos, available at any time once the PC has Moon Sickle, will turn cats 
into writhing masses of primal chaos when thrown at cats. Cats can be led over traps 
until they are killed or turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos.  Luring a cat 
across an alarm trap causes other monsters to become hostile and attack the cat. Note 
that in newer versions of ADOM, the PC is charged with killing a cat if he creates or 
sets off a trap that kills a cat. Wands of destruction can be used to safely kill cats 
since monsters "destroyed" in this way do not appear in the kill list.

PCs that are near Dwarftown can bring cats to Dwarftown and have the Priest, for instance, 
kill them.  This is probably a bit dangerous, since bringing hostile monsters into 
Dwarftown repeatedly may eventually result in some of the inhabitants becoming hostile.  
It should also be possible for PCs near the Banshee's level to bring cats to her level and 
have her wail kill them. Additional monsters that can be used include vortices.  Lure a 
cat close enough to one and allow it to explode. Be familiar with vortices before trying 
this.

Companions can kill cats for you. Cave lions and wild cats can be tamed with rat and/or 
giant rat corpses, if you have enough of them. Cave tigers can eventually be tamed with 
pieces of fresh and/or raw meat, but it requires five or more pieces. If the PC can become 
invisible, and has not attacked the cat in question, it can simply be walked away from. 
Cats can be confused with the Ventriloquism skill. While they are confused, run away. 
Cats can probably be confused or blinded by throwing potions of confusion or blindness at 
them. Again the run away tactic would be used.


0.9.3 Karmic beings

Karmic monsters come in three main varieties: karmic lizards, karmic dragons and ancient 
karmic dragons. They can be identified by the fact that they change color with each turn. 
Be very careful if the PC encounters a lizard with the 'w'alk command. It may allow the 
PC to wind up right next to the lizard, in which case you may not have time to notice the 
color change. Karmics demand caution because attacking them in melee causes the PC to 
lose the Fate Smiles intrinsic, then the Lucky intrinsic followed by cursing then dooming 
if the PC continues. This is not a 100% guaranteed effect. PCs can kill karmics in one 
hit and not suffer the consequences. However, it happens so often that karmics should not 
be engaged in melee if it is possible to avoid it. Killing them with magic, missiles, 
mindcraft or companions is the way to dispatch them. The changing color of karmics 
reflects the nature of karmic dragons. They breathe not one element, like ordinary 
dragons, but have *all* the breath attacks available, varying from turn to turn depending 
on their color. This also means that they are immune to all elemental magical attacks. 
Unfortunately karmic dragon scale mail is not available in the game. ;-) They are 
vulnerable to dragon slaying ammo.

There are such things as karmic wyrms. There is one guaranteed in the game. Thankfully, 
he is not initially hostile. Another being shares the cursing/dooming property of 
karmics: Filk, the quickling bard.

Karmic beings will occasionally leave corpses when killed.  Eating the corpse 
of a karmic being will, in order, remove the doomed intrinsic if present, remove 
the cursed intrinsic if present, grant the Lucky intrinsic if not present and 
grant the Fate Smiles intrinsic if not present.  Remember all or any of these 
intrinsics can be present simultaneously.  Thus a PC that is doomed and Lucky 
would lose the doomed intrinsic and retain the Lucky intrinsic after eating a 
karmic corpse.  The same is true for a PC that has the cursed and doomed 
intrinsics - the PC would lose the doomed intrinsic but not the cursed intrinsic 
and would not gain either the Lucky or Fate Smiles intrinsics.


0.9.4 Strategies for dealing with particularly annoying monsters

Suggestions for more annoying monsters are welcome. No uniques, though - they are dealt 
with in the section pertaining to their location.

This section is about *annoying* monsters. Not necessarily very dangerous or 
life-threatening, just monsters that are your personal pet peeve with some attack or 
characteristic that infuriates you.

Early game: 

claw bugs - Since claw bugs always ignore PV (luckily, they never damage armor) and 
            there are almost no wearable items substantially increasing DV at this 
            point in the game, fighting them in true berserker mode - wearing nothing 
            and switching tactics to berserker (see section 0.14.12) might be 
            worthwhile.  In this mode, there are good bonuses to to-hit and to-damage 
            values - usually enough to take them out in one hit.  Of course, this is 
            not necessary once the PC has some missiles and/or spells to take them out.  
            Note that claw bugs are immune to mindcraft as are all insects. They are 
            very fragile and pose a threat only due to their numerous (8 per turn!) 
            armor-punching attacks.

ghuls - They are only dangerous because of their paralyzation ability. Otherwise easy 
        to kill. PCs with halfway decent DV should not have a problem.

jellies - Jellies can be troublesome due to several of their attacks - sickness, acid, 
          poison, paralyzation, etc. Gray oozes and ochre jellies will corrode weapons 
          made of iron, mithril and adamantium or damage the PC with their acidic attacks 
          when fighting unarmed. Mithril and adamantium weapons are more resistant to 
          corrosion, but it will happen eventually - do not attempt to clear a jelly pit 
          in melee with weapons made of iron (especially), mithril or adamantium. This 
          can be problematic for a low level PC. Spells or missiles are preferable, but 
          if a low level PC must melee these critters, stone weapons are a good choice 
          since they do not corrode. Alternatively, the PC can wield a si and bash the 
          jelly with it. As an artifact, the si cannot be damaged.

          Gelatinous cubes can be particularly annoying because of their ability to 
          destroy items that are lying on the ground. Losing that waterproof blanket in 
          the SMC to one of these ugly blobs is extremely frustrating. Easily killed with 
          missiles, spells and mindcraft (!?).

          One of the nastier jellies is the stone ooze. The paralysis attack of these can 
          be very, very nasty for PC's who have no means of paralyzation resistance (such 
          as an amulet of free action). Attack them from a distance or run away.

Midgame:

dopplegangers - These are frustrating because they deflect missiles and cause 
                confusion.  Doppleganger lords are somewhat more dangerous.  
                Doppleganger kings are exceptionally dangerous even for very 
                experienced PCs: they reflect the nature of the PC exactly in terms of 
                DV and PV and may inflict substantially more damage than the PC is 
                capable of dealing.  Their speed is also nearly identical to the PC's 
                although movement cost and hitpoints are not copied.  Normal 
                dopplegangers are easily killed with spells or mindcraft.

Dorn beasts - Annoying because of their constant paralysis attack. An amulet of free 
              action will solve this problem. Less well known is the tactic of attacking 
              them in darkness or while blind.

mimics - These annoying creatures can appear in a shop when the player is least expecting 
         it (although they do not seem to show up in Terinyo or Lawenilothehl, thankfully, 
         they *do* appear in the HMV shop - a warning for players that elect to descend 
         through the UD to start the game). By the time the PC encounters them, they can 
         generally be killed; they are simply surprising and startling. One is almost 
         guaranteed in Waldenbrook's shop. Note that tension rooms full of mimics, master 
         mimics and mimic hiveminds are much more dangerous than a single mimic in a shop.

rust monsters - These beasts will rust the PC's vulnerable armor and weapons. Extremely 
                annoying, since all they have to do is touch the PC and a perfectly 
                functioning sword of sharpness or phase dagger can be reduced to a useless 
                hunk of metal. They can be pacified by throwing metal items at them. 
                Quarrels are a good choice if the PC has some expendable ones. Their 
                brethren, large rust monsters and giant rust monsters, unfortunately can 
                not be pacified in this way.

Late game:

emperor lichs - Emperor lichs are trouble. An exception to the general rule in this 
                section, these annoying monsters are quite capable of killing a PC 
                quickly. They cast Death Ray, so resistance is essential. They see 
                invisible, are stat drainers and are summoners. A group of emperor 
                lichs, such as those found in greater undead vaults, is a challenge 
                even for level 50 PCs who have won the game. They are vulnerable to 
                high effectivity fire spells. Improved Fireball with effectivity +20 
                or more and willpower 48 or greater is a spellcaster PC's friend against 
                emperor lichs.

molochs - Molochs, and their larger brethren Greater Molochs, are a significant threat. 
          Their melee attack can be for 100 HP or significantly more in the case of 
          GMs. They fall into the annoying category because it is possible to run away 
          from them with any PC that has halfway decent speed. They typically have a 
          speed in the 60-70 range.

0.9.5 Weapon status - blessed, uncursed, cursed

The damage inflicted on an opponent that falls into the demon or undead category is 
dependent on the weapon's blessed vs uncursed vs cursed status.  The formulas are as follows:

For blessed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.5) - PV
For uncursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.0) - PV
For cursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 0.5) - PV

Cursed weapons also seem to be more prone to breakage.  Blessed weapons seem to be less 
prone to breakage.


0.10 Corruption


0.10.1 What is corruption?

Corruption is unavoidable in the Drakalor Chain for any PC who wants 
to make progress in the game.  It is a background process that happens 
as a result of the chaos gate at the bottom of the Caverns of Chaos 
being open.  Some locations remain free of corruption despite the gate 
being open, notably those near the surface of the Drakalor Chain.  In 
order to get anything done, however, the PC must descend into corrupting 
areas.  It is only a matter of time after that until the first corruption 
occurs.  After ninety days of game time elapses, corruption rate doubles.  
After the gate is closed, background corruption ceases, which is nice if 
the PC wants to play tourist for a while.  However, corruption can still 
be caused by artifacts that corrupt (section 0.10.2.3) as well as
corrupting hits from monsters (section 0.10.2.2).

Note that the possible corruptions occur in random order (not the order 
listed on this page) which is decided at the beginning of the game.  
However, if one or more corruptions are removed, the RNG is reseeded and 
the corruptions will reoccur in a new random order.

The following is a complete list of corruptions along with some comments 
about their effects and workarounds:

A - You are surrounded by an unholy aura (Ch: -10, DV: +6).

This causes monsters to become afraid of the PC at more or less random times.
In their frightened state, they will flee.  A very nasty side effect is that 
shopkeepers become homicidally enraged at PCs that enter shops with this 
corruption, fearing that their customers will be frightened away.  Note that 
invisible PCs do not suffer the effects of this corruption: monsters that 
cannot see invisible do not detect this corruption.  This works for 
shopkeepers until the "*foo* stares at your position with great intensity" 
message is generated.  After that, look out.

B - You rage (DV: -9, +6 melee damage)!

Mediocre increase to damage in exchange for losing nine points of DV.  Not 
a very good bargain, especially for low level characters, since this will 
make them easier to hit (and some monster hits cause further corruption).

C - Poison drips from your hands.

Some players hate this corruption more than any other.  PCs with this 
corruption poison any monsters they engage in melee (a nice effect), turn 
any potion they touch into poison (very bad) and curse any food they touch
(very bad).  It can result in starvation quickly.  The workaround is to wear 
thick gauntlets, which negate all of the above effects.  Alchemistic gloves 
also can negate these effects when picking up potions or food items, but it 
is not guaranteed.  However, alchemistic gloves *never* block the effects 
when drinking potions or eating food.

D - You have grown thorns (3d3 melee damage, Dx: -2, Ap: -3).

The extra melee damage occurs only when fighting unarmed.  Useful for Monks 
and Beastfighters, Necromancers using Shadow Touch.  Useless waste of 2 Dx 
points for all others.

E - Your close attunement to corrupted astral space allows teleportation.

Very, very nice if the PC has teleport control.  Very, very annoying if the 
PC doesn't have teleport control.

F - You have grown a bulging cranium (Le: +6, Wi: +4, Ap: -6, PV: -4, To: -3).

Nice learning and willpower increases.  PV goes down because the PC's 
inflated skull is thinner, making it easier to damage?  Not good for 
looks or toughness either.

G - You are a living mana battery.

Another nominee for the most hated corruption. All wands the PC touches are 
drained of their charges. This does not destroy them; their final charge can 
still be wrenched from them, but extremely annoying nonetheless. There is no 
workaround. Some side benefits: 1) every time the PC drains a wand, power 
points are added to the PC's power score: blessed wands give +2, uncursed +1 
and cursed 0 2) Spell costs are reduced to 80% of their normal cost - note 
that this is not cumulative with Darknight / Silvernight reductions, since 
costs cannot drop below 50% 3) Mana regeneration is increased.

H - You have grown horns (+3 melee damage, Ap: -4).

Melee damage in exchange for Appearance.

I - Your antennae explore the details of your environment (Ap: -4).

Kicks in quasirandomly to reveal a bit of the dungeon layout in the PC's 
immediate vicinty.  Loss of Appearance.

J - Your skin is covered by tough scales (PV: +8, Dx: -6, Ap: -4).

Nice PV increase, nasty Dexterity decrease. More loss of Appearance.

K - You have grown a total of 12 eyes (Ap: -6, Pe: +6).

Nice Perception increase, still more loss of Appearance.  Getting 
the idea?  By the endgame, PCs tend to get *ugly*.  ;-)

L - You exhale sulphur (Ch: -4).

This enables the PC to spit a corrosive acid much the same as a 
Drakeling's racial ability.

M - You look somewhat apish (St: +3, Le: -1, Wi: -1, Ch: -2, Ap: -3).

This corruption's effects reoccur periodically. Its effects are cumulative 
over time, so the PC keeps gaining Strength while losing Learning, Willpower, 
etc. The game notifies you when this is happening with the phrase "You 
suddenly remember your ancestors." Nice for fighter types, nasty for 
spellcasters.

N - Your corrupted tissue seems to heal much faster.

Another corruption causing cumulative effects. The PC heals faster, but the 
process leaves scars which reduce both Dexterity and Appearance by one point 
for each scar. Nasty over time.

O - Your feet have been transformed into hooves (+8 kicking damage, Dx: -6).

Nasty loss of Dexterity, especially since most PCs aren't kickers anyway.

P - You have become extremely thin and nimble (1/2 weight, DV: +6).

Very nice corruption, probably the best.  Six points of DV with no downside.
This is one of the corruptions needed to enter the quickling tree.

Q - Your muscles have stiffened slowing you down (base action cost: 1500 energy
    points; PV: +4, St: +2).

Another hated corruption.  Slows down all your movement by 1.5X.

R - You have become very light (1/10 weight, St: -6, Dx: +4, To: -6, Ap: -6,
    +20 speed).

Bad Strength and Toughness losses in exchange for speed and Dexterity.
And yes, more appearance loss.  This is the other corruption needed to 
enter the quickling tree.

Becoming corrupted beyond this point turns the PC into a chaos creature 
and the game ends at that point.  All those purple 'j's are probably former 
adventurers.

0.10.2 Gaining corruptions

The game keeps track of corruption with a numerical value which increments each time  
twenty turns pass in a corrupting zone. Note that there are 18 corruptions listed 
above.  For each 1000 "points" of corruption, the PC gains one corruption.  Simple 
arithmetic shows that 180 points equals 1% corruption and the PC gains a new 
corruption each time he passes a multiple of 1000/180 = 5.556%.  This is a strict
rule only up to 99% corruption.  The 99% corruption level begins at 99 * 180 = 17820 
corruption points, but the PC is given extra leeway at this point and does not 
transform into a chaos creature until the counter is over 19000 points.

0.10.2.1 Background corruption

As mentioned above, the PC must eventually enter areas where background corruption 
occurs.  The following tables show the corruption points gained in various areas:

Note that a corrupting level can be made less so, or even completely 
noncorrupting, by reading scrolls of peace.  These reduce the danger 
level, and thus the corruption rate of the current level.  Bless the 
scrolls before reading them.  The number of scrolls required depends on 
the level.  If Dwarftown is generated on D: 10 or D: 11, for instance, 
reading two blessed scrolls of peace will probably stop corruption.  On 
the other hand, if it is necessary to stop corruption on a particular 
level of the blue dragon caves, approximately nine scrolls of peace are 
required.


0.10.2.2 Corruption traps

Corruption traps are as common as any other trap in the dungeons.
They cause a slight amount of corruption.  They are purple when
revealed.


0.10.2.3 Corrupting hits from monsters

Some monsters corrupt by hitting the PC in melee.  Common ones
include chaos brothers, chaos sisters and the grues found in
the elemental temples.  Appendix J contains a complete list.


0.10.2.4 Artifacts which corrupt

0.10.2.4.1 Moon Sickle

Moon Sickle is a unique artifact unlike any other in the game.  It does not
contain the essence of Chaos and Corruption and so does not corrupt merely
by carrying it.  Likewise, wielding it does not cause corruption.  However,
successfully hitting a monster with Moon Sickle adds 2d3 corruption points to
the PC's corruption counter.  Although it has no slaying powers, it is worth
considering as a weapon against very difficult monsters for those PCs who have
trained polearms, despite its corrupting nature.  It has excellent base damage
at 10d4+6 and polearms have decent to-hit and to-damage modifiers.  Remember,
however, that Moon Sickle is autocursing.


0.10.2.4.2 When carried

The following artifacts contain the essence of Chaos and
Corruption and will corrupt the PC merely by carrying them:

The Black Tome of Alsophocus
The Amulet of Raw Steel
The Shield of Raw Steel
The Boots of Great Speed
The Sceptre of Chaos
The Medal of Chaos
The Crown of Chaos

Additional research will be required to quantitate the effects.


0.10.2.4.3 When used

All of the Chaos Orbs fall into this category, however, there is a great deal
of difference in the amount of corruption caused by using the different Chaos
Orbs. Stephen White has determined the precise amount of corruption caused:

Corruption caused by using the Chaos Orbs

Chaos Orb  Corruption points added per use

Water       600
Fire        300
Air         500
Earth       300
Mana        4950

Note that if a PC is wearing the elemental gauntlets when the orbs are used, 
the above corruption points are halved.


0.10.2.5 Potions of raw chaos

Logically enough, if the PC drinks a potion of raw chaos it will cause
corruption.  They can also corrupt, however, if the PC tries to use
them to polymorph an item by dipping it in the potion.  There is a
chance the PC will spill the potion, which causes about four corruptions 
as well as 100 - 200 HP of damage.


0.10.2.6 Tracts of chaos

Tracts of chaos are not well understood. They probably grant corruption
at the expense of piety towards the PC's chaotic god, but this needs
testing.


0.10.2.7 From pools

Drinking from pools may result in the message "You feel corrupted!"
Self-explanatory.


0.10.2.8 From corpses

Some corpses will corrupt the PC if eaten.  Obvious ones include the
corpses of the Chaos Orb guardians.  Others include Keethrax, Keriax
and chaos animals.

The effects will be compiled here eventually.  Until then you can browse
Appendix J for corruptions resulting from eating monster corpses.


0.10.2.9 Riurry - the Greater Black Unicorn quest

Riurry will reward the PC with 1 - 2 corruptions for killing the Greater
White Unicorn Yrruir.


0.10.2.10 Being crowned a champion of chaos

Being crowned a champion of chaos will cause 2 - 3 immediate corruptions
in addition to making further corruption faster.

0.10.3 Removing corruptions

There will be a time when your PC wants to remove one or more corruptions.  Some
corruptionsare very troublesome and worth getting rid of immediately.  Later in 
the game, removing corruptions may be necessary simply to extend the life of the 
PC. Whatever the reason, a thorough knowledge of how to remove corruptions should 
be part of every experienced player's repertoire.  There are several ways of doing 
this as outlined below.  Corruption removal items are among the most precious in 
the game.  They should always be blessed unless the PC is trying to specifically 
remove only one corruption that is impossible to deal with (poison hands can be 
impossible to deal with without thick gauntlets) while preserving others (for 
instance one needed to enter the quickling tree).


0.10.3.1 Potions of cure corruption

Potions of cure corruption are exactly what the name implies - they remove corruption,
approximately 0.75 corruptions for each blessed potion of cure corruption the PC drinks.
A potion of cure corruption is also a quest object for Gaab'Baay.

Beware of cursed potions of cure corruption.  They cause corruption rather 
than curing it.

Magnus Malm has done some research on potions of cure corruption:

Potions of cure corruption

Status   Ten trials: corruption points added or removed     Min   Ave   Max

Cursed   +147 +139 +151 +147 +168 +138 +147 +122 +150 +162  +138  +147  +168
Uncursed -298 -298 -283 -258 -296 -291 -279 -275 -304 -279  -258  -286  -304
Blessed  -695 -733 -735 -795 -734 -812 -826 -841 -804 -716  -695  -769  -841


0.10.3.1.1 Obtaining potions of cure corruption from Guth'Alak

Potions of cure corruption can be obtained from the druid Guth'Alak in Terinyo.
He will reward a non-chaotic PC with a potion of cure corruption for delivering a
greater chaos creature's or highly corrupted creature's corpse to him.  Examples
are the corpses of Chaos Orb guardians, Keriax and Keethrax.  Black unicorn corpses
and greater black unicorn corpses also work.  If the PC is chaotic, it is a good
idea to sell a chaos creature's corpse to Munxip for safekeeping, then buy it back
at a later time when the PC is non-chaotic.  It can then be traded to Guth'Alak for
a potion of cure corruption.


0.10.3.2 Scrolls of chaos resistance

Blessed scrolls of chaos resistance remove about 1.5 corruptions per reading. There are
several places where scrolls of chaos resistance can be obtained: The only absolutely
guaranteed location is the hidden room in the High Mountain Village. This will always
contain one scroll of chaos resistance, although beware - it is always cursed.
Khelavaster will give six scrolls of chaos resistance to a PC that manages to save him.
The dwarven mystic in Dwarftown usually gives four blessed scrolls of chaos resistance
to neutral PCs.  Finally, the Mad Minstrel will reward a PC who brings him the Weird
Tome with five cursed scrolls of chaos resistance.

Beware of cursed scrolls of chaos resistance.  They cause corruption rather
than curing it.

Magnus Malm has done some research on scrolls of chaos resistance:


Scrolls of chaos resistance

Status   Ten trials: corruption points added or removed                Min    Ave    Max

Cursed   +293  +286  +301  +304  +324  +304  +311  +307  +284  +299    +284   +301   +324
Uncursed -595  -567  -539  -565  -618  -514  -562  -552  -500  -533    -500   -555   -618
Blessed  -1649 -1512 -1458 -1561 -1415 -1542 -1561 -1279 -1507 -1652   -1415  -1544  -1652

Note that these numbers are to a first approximation double those of potions of cure
corruption. Thus cursed SoCRs are twice as bad as cursed PoCCs, while blessed SoCRs are
twice as good as blessed PoCCs.  The implications should be obvious: never read any 
cursed corruption removal item, and bless SoCRs in any but a dire emergency.


0.10.3.3 Tracts of order

Reading a tract of order amounts to an appeal to the lawful god for corruption removal. 
This is not free and uses up piety. Do not try this with a PC who does not have a very 
good relationship with his lawful god.  In any case, the amount of corruption removed
appears to be small. Tracts of order are most useful to get rid of an annoying corruption 
as soon as it occurs, thus reseeding the RNG and hopefully avoiding it the next time a PC 
receives a corruption.


0.10.3.4 Yrruir - the Greater White Unicorn quest

Yrruir will remove all corruption *once* as a reward for the PC killing the 
Greater Black Unicorn - Riurry.  It is wise to wait to use this cleansing until 
it is absolutely necessary. If the PC is doing a normal ending, this should 
ideally be the last thing the PC does before leaving the Drakalor Chain to 
insure a corruption-free ending, which leads to better scores and a happier 
future history for the PC after the game is over.


0.11 Companions and slaves


0.11.1 Companions

Companions are allies who will help the PC, to a point. They can be obtained in several 
ways as outlined below. Companions are often referred to as pets if they are animals. 
One word of caution before attempting to create a powerful companion - they are fickle 
and will sometimes turn on the PC at the slightest provocation. Some types of companions 
have a distinct personality and bear careful watching. A high charisma score is very 
helpful when ordering companions about. Most companions (not undead like an Emperor Lich) 
can be healed using any of the normal techniques - casting Heal and throwing potions of 
healing, for example.

One problem that many players have with companions (or slaves) is that companions have a 
fixed speed. This means that as the game progresses and the PC gains speed via wearables, 
the Athletics skill, eating quickling corpses, etc., companions become slower and slower 
relative to the PC. This can become very annoying, with the PC forced to wait for 
companions to catch up. This problem makes many players reluctant to rely too heavily on 
companions.

Note also that companions cannot accompany PCs to D:50. Companions can be *created* on 
D:50, but they cannot cross D:49.


0.11.1.1 Scrolls of Familiar Summoning

These scrolls can be read to create a tame monster. The monster created is dependent on 
the danger level of the dungeon level. This means it is to the PC's advantage to read 
these in the most dangerous place possible. In the early midgame, the best place is 
probably the Dwarven Halls, since almost anything can show up there. Ancient karmic 
dragon, emperor lich and balor companions have been generated in the Dwarven Halls, for 
instance.


0.11.1.2 Figurines of wondrous power

These miniature statues are a relatively new feature in ADOM, implemented by TB in 
response to players' requests for pet shops. Figurines can also be found randomly in the 
dungeons. They generate a monster when 'u'sed; the type of monster corresponds to the 
name (i.e. a jackal figurine of wondrous power). If the figurine is blessed when 'u'sed, 
the monster produced is tame. As with scrolls of familiar summoning, it is best to use 
them in a dangerous place. The Small Cave is ideal, since newly generated monsters have 
roughly twice the experience level of the PC.


0.11.1.3 Taming monsters

This is a specialty of bards, but any PC with the Music skill can try to tame monsters by 
placing a musical instrument in the tool slot and 'u'sing it. Most PCs are not very 
successful at this until the Music skill level is in the 90s. The success rate is also 
dependent on the type of instrument used, with heavier instruments generally better than 
light ones.

Beggars can be made into companions by giving them gold and/or food.  The most recent 
report (December 28th, 2001) required about 8000 gold pieces and 10 cooked lizards.

Some monsters can be tamed by feeding them.  Cave lions and wild cats can be tamed by 
giving them rat or giant rat corpses.  This is very useful to remember if the PC wants 
the Ring of the Master Cat (see section 3.6).  Cave tigers can also be tamed, but they 
refuse to eat rat or giant rat corpses.  Instead, they like pieces of raw or fresh meat.  
Unfortunately, it takes more than five pieces of meat to completely tame them; this is 
out of reach for most PC's.  Wild cats (cave lions? cave tigers?) can also be tamed with 
fish, which can be obtained from water squares in the wilderness (see Section 0.4 re 
Survival).  Dogs can be tamed by giving them bones, which are readily available by killing 
skeletons.  This can be especially useful with blink dogs.  Tame a blink dog with bones, 
then get it involved in a fight.  The blink dog will summon more of his brethren, some of 
which will inevitably be killed.  A blink dog corpse will eventually be generated, which 
grants teleport control when eaten.  This is particularly useful for lawful PCs.  Since 
blink dogs are lawful, killing them will wreak havoc on a lawful PC's alignment.


0.11.1.4 Hawkslayer

The burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village will join a PC and act as a companion 
providing certain criteria are met: the PC must not be chaotic and the player (*not* the PC) 
must know a secret password ("Iceberg"). The only way to learn the password in ADOM itself 
is drinking from pools, and many players are reluctant to do so. Some players may remember 
Hawkslayer from the computer RPG "Bard's Tale III". The password is the same in that game.  
There is also an experience level requirement which is uncertain.  Level 25 PC's have 
successfully gotten Hawkslayer as a companion, so that stands as a maximum level for the 
requirement at the moment.

Hawkslayer is not super-buff as companions go, but he is not bad. 

On arriving at the HMV with a level 15 PC and using a blessed stethoscope on him, 
Hawkslayer was found to be:

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 15, 
Hits: 355, Attacks: 1, Damage: 14-50. Speed: 120.

A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup on September 14th, 2000 described a PC who was 
very careful with Hawkslayer to start, training him in the upper levels of the CoC, 
proceeding to the Big Room then deeper into the CoC until he was able to take on molochs 
and balors. Using a blessed stethoscope on him at that point gave the following:

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 110, DV: 96, PV: 36, 
Hits: 805, Attacks: 11, Damage: 50-86. Speed:120.

Quite impressive.

Hawkslayer uses eternium arrows which can be retrieved for the PC's own use.

It is possible to equip Hawkslayer with items in ADOM 1.0.0.  If the PC drops certain 
equipment to the ground next to him hewill pick up the items and equip them.

Unfortunately he will not wear body armor, but will equip boots, cloaks, gauntlets and 
shields.  Be very careful, however.  He will not equip these items after he is the PC's 
companion.  The items must simply be dropped next to him *before* giving him the secret 
password.  This behavior will probably change in future versions of ADOM.


0.11.2 Slaves

Slaves are the undead created to serve a necromancer PC. They share some characteristics 
with companions. They will fight against a necromancer PC's opponents up to the point 
where injuries cause them to panic and become afraid of further combat. As with 
companions, a high Charisma score enables the necromancer to better control his slaves. 
Note that traditional methods of healing damage undead rather than healing them. The 
Bless spell also damages undead. Undead in skeletal form (skeletons and skeletal 
warriors) can be healed by giving them bones. Others must simply heal at their natural 
rate, which is often frustratingly slow.

If a necromancer manages to survive to a high enough level to find quickling corpses, 
especially higher-level quickling corpses, most of the problems with undead vanish. 
Quicklings are considered humanoid in ADOM and so their corpses can be animated with 
necromancy. They are extremely fast (this also means the problem with slow companions 
vanishes, see section 0.11.1) and regenerate wounds at a phenomenal rate. One particular 
quickling king skeletal warrior on record killed Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage, before 
the PC knew it had happened.

Note that slaves are not subject to the experience level 50 limit as PCs are. It is quite 
possible for slaves to reach experience level 100 and higher. Needless to say, they 
become formidable at those levels.

One trick necromancers can use to create out of depth slaves is to exploit the properties 
of the small cave (check section 1.2.3 for a general explanation of how the small cave 
works). In this scenario, a necromancer PC avoids entering the small cave at the 
beginning of the game, instead gaining early experience in the infinite dungeon or 
elsewhere. As the game progresses, a source of invisibility will eventually be found. It 
is rare for monsters that see invisible to be generated in the small cave. At the same 
time, many are humanoid and their corpses are usable for necromancy. If an experience 
level 20 necromancer enters the small cave while invisible, he can reasonably expect to 
leave or descend into the unremarkable dungeon with a couple of level 35 - 40 slaves. 
Very useful at that point in the game.

Below is a chart that shows the choices a level 50 necromancer has for creating undead. 
More detail will be added to this, indicating exactly what experience level is required 
for each undead type. Note that the mana cost to create some undead will be higher for 
lower level PCs.


  Undead being                                             Mana Cost

0.12 Intrinsics


0.12.1 Resistance

There are various resistances available. These are:

Damage types: fire, cold, acid, shock
Special attacks: paralysis, petrification, poison, confusion, death rays, sleep, stun

Remember that resistance does NOT equal immunity in ADOM, i.e. being hit by a death ray 
while resistant will not kill you instantly, but will still deal a significant amount 
of damage.

Some of the resistances can be gained by eating an appropriate monster corpse:

Intrinsic fire resistance can be gained by eating the corpse of fire-related creatures. 
The game generates messages related to this:

Fire beetle (10% chance of gaining fire resistance):

You suddenly feel very hot! (whether or not resistance has actually been granted)

Fire lizard : (50% chance of gaining fire resistance):

You suddenly shiver. (fire resistance granted)
This stuff cools you down! (fire resistance not granted)

Larger fire creatures, e.g. fire drakes, red dragons, etc. seem to grant fire resistance 
every time.

There are further considerations about fire resistance in the Tower of Eternal Flames. 
See section 2.19 for more explanation.

Cold resistance can be gained by eating a white dragon corpse.

Acid resistance can be gained by eating ankheg, ant or black dragon corpses.

Shock resistance can be gained by eating lightning lizard or blue dragon corpses.

Poison resistance can be gained by eating giant centipede, snake or spider corpses. 
Be aware that this both poisons the PC and grants resistance, so the PC will have 
to endure a brief period of poisoning.

An interesting test conducted by Petri Sihvola regarding petrification by a gorgon's 
breath:

> I did some testing and there's an approximate 50% chance of dying 
> to a gorgon breath without resistance. However, if DV is high enough 
> the chance is drastically reduced. This one shows my DV and how many 
> times I died:

> DV:23  10/20
> DV:44   8/20
> DV:53   1/20
> DV:69   0/20

> This was also without the alertness skill.


0.12.2 Immunity

Immunity to the four basic damage types is possible: fire, cold, acid and shock. 
Immunity means that the PC will take no damage from the corresponding elemental 
attack. However, creatures which deal elemental damage can still harm the PC, 
due to their ability to deal physical damage. The PC is only immune to damage from 
the elemental attack.

Obtaining immunities: 

Crowning: 

    grants an immunity to one of fire, cold, acid or shock

Wearables: 

    dragon scale mail grants immunity to the corresponding element: 
        red - fire 
        white - cold 
        blue - shock 
        black - acid
    the Ancient Mummy Wrapping grants immunity to cold 
    the girdle "Celestrix" grants immunity to shock (if it still exists) 
    the Crown of Science grants immunity to fire 
    the shield of raw steel grants immunity to fire and cold 
    the armor "Nature's Companion" grants immunity to fire and shock 
    the Ring of Immunity grants all four immunities

Wielded weapons: 

    the Scorched Spear grants immunity to cold 
    the rune-covered trident grants immunity to cold 
    the hammer of the gods grants immunity to shock 
    the mighty morning star "Grod" grants immunity to fire 
    the Staff of the Wanderer grants immunity to shock 
    the Trident of the Red Rooster grants all four immunities

Corpses: 

    Eating a giant slug corpse grants immunity to acid
    Eating a *blessed* lightning lizard corpse has a 12.5% 
           chance of granting shock immunity
    Eating Srraxxarrakex's corpse grants immunity to shock

Class powers:

    Assassins receive immunity to poison at level 40
    Druids receive shock immunity at level 40
    Weaponsmiths receive fire immunity at level 32


0.12.3 Dooming and Cursing

Dooming or Cursing, as might be expected from the names, is generally to be avoided. 
They result from committing acts that are very contrary to the PCs alignment. For 
example, robbing shops with a lawful PC may cause both cursing and dooming. Robbing a 
shop with a neutral PC may cause only cursing. Robbing a shop with a neutral PC and 
killing the shopkeeper on the way out will quite likely cause both dooming and cursing. 
They are also quite commonly obtained by drinking from pools. Cursing makes the game 
nudge all the die-rolls against the PC, generate more monsters which hit harder while 
the PC's hits become weaker. Dooming is a more severe form of this. Dooming also 
increases food consumption, makes traps more difficult to avoid and makes it much more 
difficult to pray for divine help.

Nevertheless, there are ways to exploit these intrinsics. These techniques are not for 
the beginner, of course. Since monsters become tougher, they are worth more experience 
and carry better items. Vaults become more common. If the PC wants to achieve Grand 
Mastery in a weapon class, becoming Cursed and/or Doomed in the wilderness is the only 
way to do it in a reasonable time frame.

Dooming and cursing can be removed by sacrificing at a coaligned altar. It may take 
considerable sacrificing to remove the Cursed/Doomed intrinsics, since they are only 
removed at the "very close" level of piety.  Praying while the PC is already at very 
close status also may remove dooming and/or cursing, although these intrinsics make 
it more difficult to appeal for divine assistance, as noted above. Removing Dooming 
(only) results in the message "You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from you." 
Removing Cursing (only) results in the message "You feel relieved." Removing both 
Cursing and Dooming simultaneously results in only the "You feel a terrible gloom 
being lifted from you." message.

Another trick for exploiting the Doomed state is as follows: If a PC finds an altar 
early in the game, ideally before the Si level so that zero or very few artifacts have 
been generated, the PC should purchase or acquire plenty of food (cooked lizards and/or 
stomafillia herbs), become Doomed by eating a Dooming corpse (daemons and quasits spring 
to mind) or wearing a ring of Doom, and then exploit the heavy monster generation by 
sacrificing the monsters on the altar. This can quickly lead to very close or even 
extremely close status. After the Dooming is removed, by removing a cursed ring of doom 
or through reaching very close status, the PC can be crowned or precrowned.

Dooming also has an effect in dark rooms: if a Doomed PC wanders into a dark room, there 
is a 1 in 1000 chance for an instakill every turn "You are likely to be eaten by a grue." 
(this only applies to Doomed characters).

Deliberately playing in a Cursed or Doomed state is dangerous and should be reserved for 
those players who know exactly why they are doing it.


0.12.4 Lucky and Fate Smiles

The Lucky and Fate Smiles intrinsics are the good counterparts to the Cursing and Dooming 
intrinsics, respectively. They cause the game to nudge die-rolls in the PC's favor. The 
effect is not as dramatic as the Dooming and Cursing intrinsics. It should be noted that 
all four intrinsics may be present simultaneously. The negative ones are considerably 
stronger.

The Lucky and Fate Smiles intrinsics are naturally gained by PCs as they sacrifice on 
coaligned altars; the messages are:

"You feel an inner strength lifting your spirits!" - The Lucky intrinsic
"You feel very close to -deity-." - The Fate Smiles intrinsic


0.12.5 Teleportitis and teleport control

Teleportitis is a "disease" that causes your PC to teleport around randomly. It is 
obtainable from pools ("You feel jumpy"), corruption ("your close attunement to corrupted 
astral space allows teleportation"), from eating the right corpse (pixie) and items (helm 
of teleportation, cloak of Oman). It can be useful for escaping tight spots such as being 
surrounded by monsters (though it never seems to kick in when needed ;), for shoplifting 
and for reaching areas that are usually inaccessible.

Teleport control allows you to choose the destination when teleporting your PC. It works 
whether the cause of the teleportation is teleportitis or deliberate, such as zapping a 
wand of teleportation or casting the Teleport spell at the PC's current location. 
Mindcrafters always get teleport control at experience level one, others have to rely on 
eating the right corpse (blink dog), drinking from pools ("you feel like jumping around") 
or wearing items (amulet/ring of teleport control).


0.12.6 Special birth messages

The night you were born....

...the local undead were seen packing up and moving away.

It means that your character will gain (or is born with?) the "natural enemy of undead" 
intrinsic. This makes undead flee from you periodically.

...your long lost brother showed up.

Greater chance of special locations generated in dungeons (hives, shops, pools, etc.)

...a two headed calf was born.

This one means that you get better dice rolls in your level-up skill increases. Probably 
double.

...a falling star killed the village elder.

Not known for certain: Probably a bonus to proficiency with (a) missile weapon(s), 
possibly an attribute bonus.


0.12.7 Water breathing

It is possible to gain the water breathing intrinsic by eating Blup's or Shyssiryxxius' 
corpse. The message "For some seconds a strange liquid seems to fill your lungs." is 
generated.

Elementalists receive water breathing as an intrinsic class power at experience level 25. 
Certain items and wielded weapons grant the intrinsic. The most common items are probably 
the helm of water breathing and amulet of water breathing.

Other items which grant this ability include:

rings of the fish - AUTOCURSING; 1 blessed or 2 of any status stop drowning damage, 
                    although water breathing is not listed as an intrinsic at the time.
the rune-covered trident - when wielded
the Trident of the Red Rooster - when wielded
the Medal of Chaos - when worn

 through stone, uncovering an item dropped by a monster that was killed while in the wall
"The altar is smashed by the greater moloch! An energy bolt strikes down on the greater moloch!
 The greater moloch shruggs it off and laughs with malicious glee!" - pretty self-explanatory
"*SORRY, MISSED*" - the above happens, but the PC is doomed; the god strikes at the PC by mistake
"You hit something and notice a thudding sound." - the PC killed an invisible monster with a missile
"Drops of blood appear on the ground." - an invisible monster is bleeding


0.13.2 Traps

Traps are exactly what the name implies. They are represented by carets ^ in the dungeon 
maps once they are discovered. There are several varieties which do various nasty things 
to the PC or his worn or carried inventory:


Acid trap           green caret        damages or destroys non-artifact worn equipment
Alarm trap          orange caret       warns every monster on the level of the PC's 
                                       presence and causes them to become hostile
Arrow trap          white caret        shoots an arrow at the PC; can be exploited to 
                                       gain arrows
Ceiling trap        dark blue caret    drops a portion of the ceiling on the PC; 
                                       only found in the mana temple
Corruption trap     purple caret       corrupts the PC; a relatively small effect
Explosion trap      red caret          generates a fireball at the location of the trap
Light trap          yellow caret       blinds the PC
Pit trap            brown caret        PC falls into a hole; can be used to train 
                    OR cyan caret      Climbing; two types, one contains vipers; appear 
                                       as cyan caret if detected with a wand of trap 
                                       detection, brown caret if detected with the Detect 
                                       Traps skill (this may well be a bug)
Spear trap          brown caret        shoots a spear at the PC; can be exploited as a 
                                       source of metal
Stone block trap    gray caret         drops a stone block on the PC; can kill low level 
                                       PCs
Teleportation trap  light green caret  teleports the PC; sometimes handy for on-demand 
                                       teleportation
Water trap          blue caret         causes a gush of water; can destroy scrolls if the 
                                       PC does not have a waterproof blanket to protect 
                                       the backpack; rusts vulnerable armor and weapons

Traps can be deliberately set off by standing on the trap and pressing ctrl-T.

It should be noted that traps affect monsters as well as the PC: light traps will blind 
monsters, corruption traps will corrupt monsters, acid traps will damage monsters, etc.
An interesting use for an alarm trap is to lure a monster across it.  Other monsters 
will become hostile towards the monster which triggered the trap and attack it.  This 
can be very handy for disposing of cats (see section 0.9.2).

Traps can be discovered with the Detect Traps skill. PCs with this skill automatically 
apply it when the 's'earch command is used. In ordinary dungeons it is not worth using 
this technique, but in heavily trapped areas (the underground level of the Dwarven 
Graveyard, the Pyramid, certain elemental temples) it is definitely prudent to use this 
skill multiple times during every turn where the PC suspects a trap is present.

Traps are much easier to avoid once they are discovered, probably by a factor of 100 or 
more. This is why the Detect Traps skill is so useful. Every PC should attempt to gain 
this skill. Wands of trap detection can be used for this, but they run out of charges. 
They can be recharged of course, but the skill never runs out and is unaffected by the 
mana battery corruption.

Traps occur in a known pattern. The order, left to right or top to bottom, is:

Light trap
Corruption trap
Stone block trap
Alarm
Arrow trap
Acid trap
Pit - this pit is distinct from the other in that it contains vipers
Spear trap
Teleportation trap
Water trap
Fireball trap
Pit - simple pit, no vipers

There are several places on fixed-layout levels where trap types and locations are shown 
in these documents. Note that trap *types*, in particular, are dependent upon the dungeon 
level where the fixed-layout level in question is generated. Examples include Dwarftown 
and (most of) the elemental temples. There is generally a warning in those sections 
concerning variations caused by differing dungeon level. There is also variability 
introduced if the player chooses to play with nonstandard resolution. There is no warning 
about this factor. Nevertheless, the above pattern applies; identifying a single trap 
allows the player to predict the type of trap generated elsewhere on the level.

Finally, bear in mind that PCs with high Alertness, Perception and Dexterity stats will 
avoid undiscovered traps much more successfully than those without these abilities.

Note that it is not possible to use the 'w5' (walk in place) command while standing on 
a trap.


0.13.3 Doors

There are doors on many of the dungeon room entrances. The majority of doors are not a 
problem. However, they can be locked or locked and trapped.


0.13.3.1 Locked doors

Locked doors can be opened using several methods. The most obvious is with a key that 
fits the lock. Keys are randomly found in the dungeons. Skriek, the ratling in 
Lawenilothehl, also sells keys. Blessed keys will generally open a locked door without 
setting off a trap if one is present. A message is generated: "You notice a clicking 
sound." meaning a trap was bypassed. Cursed keys will often break when used, setting off 
a trap in the process, if one is present. Doors can be kicked down; this will set off a 
trap every time if one is present.  An unsuccessful attempt to kick down a non-trapped 
door yields the message "You kick the door but it does not budge." An unsuccessful attempt 
to kick down a trapped door yields the message "You kick the door but it does not budge at 
all."  In this case the PC was extremely lucky, since kicking a trapped door almost 
invariably sets off the trap. Huge rocks or anvils can be thrown at doors to smash them. 
Doors can be tunneled around with a pickaxe. The safest way to open a door is with the 
Knock spell or a wand of knocking. A magical breeze blows the door open and traps are 
completely bypassed.

As with traps, door locks occur in a known pattern. The order, left to right or top to 
bottom, is:

Tiny lock
Square lock
Round lock
Triangular lock
Hexagonal lock
Small lock


0.13.3.2 Door traps

There are different types of door traps:


Collapsing door drops door directly in front of doorway, damages the PC and worn equipment
Explosive rune  arguably the worst door trap, destroys a variety of worn items and 
                backpack items and damages the PC; a new effect in ADOM 1.1.x+ is possible 
                deafening of the PC
Fireball trap   similar to the explosion trap, generates a fireball, can injure 
                companions, making them become hostile
Flash           blinds the PC temporarily, also can stun the PC - might be two different 
                types of traps
Trick door      similar to the stone block trap, drops stones directly in front of the 
                door, can kill low level PCs

Players should get into the habit of never standing directly in front of a door when 
opening it whenever possible. This will completely eliminate deaths from trick door traps 
and damage from collapsing doors. It also lessens the damage from an explosive rune: "You 
partially evade the explosion." As with ordinary traps, PCs with high Dexterity are more 
successful at evading door traps: "Suddenly a huge rock drops directly in front of the 
door! You barely evade it by jumping backwards!"

If the PC has the Detect Traps skill, it is worth 'a'pplying it a few times in the 
direction of closed doors.


0.13.3.3 Secret doors

Some doors are hidden and must be 's'earched for.  A ring of searching will do this 
automatically.  Alternatively, secret doors may be discovered by 'k'icking them.  Kicking a 
normal dungeon wall results in the message "You hurt your foor kicking the wall!".  Kicking a 
concealed secret door results in the message "You really hurt your foot kicking the wall!"


0.13.4 Dark rooms

Dark rooms, and dark areas in general, are just that - dark. They are problematic since 
approaching enemies can't be seen. It is also possible to inadvertantly kill a creature 
in a dark room. The darkness can be permanently dispelled with the Light spell or a wand 
of light. A torch or an amulet of light provides a temporary light source. If a doomed 
PC enters a dark room, there is a 1 in 1000 chance of being instakilled by a grue each 
turn.


0.13.5 Tension rooms, threatening rooms

Tension rooms are relatively small rooms filled with monsters. They always have doors 
that cause the walls around them to crumble. This allows the monsters within to swarm 
the PC. They can be filled with monsters of one type, two separate types or a variety 
of different monsters. Mixed tension rooms in particular can contain out-of-depth 
monsters. Since the level message "You sense a certain tension." is always associated 
with these rooms, the PC is forewarned. It is prudent to find out what is in the tension 
room with a wand of monster detection, especially at deeper dungeon levels. It is quite 
possible to be faced with a ghost king and ancient karmic dragon simultaneously from 
such a room.

A new variant of tension rooms has appeared in ADOM 1.0.0+.  The level message "You feel 
threatened." is generated on levels containing these rooms.  These rooms are similar to 
tension rooms, but are always filled with a single type of monster. In addition, they do 
not have the crumbling walls feature of tension rooms.


0.13.6 Herbs

Herb bushes are always found in the Big Room (level 6 of the Caverns of Chaos) and 
randomly elsewhere in the dungeons. They grow according to Conway's Life rules. They are 
as follows:

If the bush has 0 or 1 neighboring bush, it will die in the next generation
If the bush has 2 or 3 neighboring bushes, it will survive through the next generation
If the bush has 4 neighboring bushes, it will die in the next generation
If an empty dungeon square has 3 neighboring bushes, a new bush will grow during the next 
generation

Births and deaths are simultaneous

ADOM adds to this: if a bush has two neighbors, it will remain the same during the next 
generation. If a bush has three neighbors, it will generate more blossoms during the next 
generation. These additions are important, since there are many stable patterns, but very 
few that will continue to blossom over time. For instance the following patterns are 
stable:


                                       *     *     
                                      * *   * *     
                                      * *    *    
                                       *           

but are quite useless as far as ADOM is concerned. Since none of the bushes has three 
neighbors, once they reach a withered state they will never recover. The best pattern to 
create for farming herbs in ADOM is a 2 x 2 square of herbs. This will remain alive 
indefinitely and generate more herb blossoms every generation. It is also worth preserving 
a 1 x 3 pattern. This is a pattern that oscillates between horizontal and vertical. Since 
two of the herb bushes are new each generation and therefore unpicked, they will 
constantly be renewed. The danger with this pattern is overharvesting. If one bush dies, 
they all die. The square 2 x 2 pattern does not have this liability. If one (and only one) 
bush dies, it will be filled in the next generation.

Herbs apparently require light to survive. A message "It's dark here! Some herb bushes 
full of blossoms are growing here. The vegetation beneath your feet shrivels and suddenly 
is gone." has been observed.

Herbs have the following properties:


Name            Method of use   Cursed effect      Uncursed effect        Blessed effect

stomafillia          eat        satiates less      satiates               bloats

See section 0.6.1.3 for more on training stats with herbs.

Herbs can be generated on any dungeon level by 'U'sing a potion of holy water on a 
dungeon square, even for PCs without the Gardening skill.  The success rate is about 
33%.  Note that while any dungeon level will work, only those levels which already 
had herbs will support herb growth.  In other words, herbs will not undergo the normal 
growth cycle unless the dungeon level had indigenous herbs.  Consequently, the PC should 
avoid creating herbs in this manner unless the dungeon level already has herbs, unless 
it is a matter of life or death.  Be sure to take advantage of the information below 
about creating especially desirable herbs.

Reproduced here is a 

-----short treatise on herbs by the newsgroup poster known as Loves A Dustbin-----:

The patterns governing herb growth are well documented elsewhere, but it is also quite 
easy to tell what kind of herb a given bush will produce. How? It's determined by the 
line on the screen at which the bush appears. Using the big room as a guide, the first 
screen line at which a floor or dungeon feature can appear is line 5, whose herb bushes 
always produce morgia roots. The line below that is home to moss of mareilon, and below 
that is the mighty spenseweed. Curaria mancox/devil's roses are next, followed by 
alraunia antidote/demon daisy, followed by stomafillia/stomacemptia, followed by pepper 
petal/burb root. The line after pepper petal is morgia root again, and the pattern 
repeats. Presented more visually (and best viewed in a monospaced font):

(line no.
  mod 7)  type of herb found at that line
---------+--------------------------------
    5    | morgia root
    6    | moss of mareilon
    0    | spenseweed
    1    | curaria mancox/devil's rose
    2    | alraunia antidote/demon daisy
    3    | stomafillia/stomacemptia
    4    | pepper petal/burb root

If you don't know what "line number mod 7" means in the above chart, feel free to ignore 
it. Just remember that the pattern starts with morgia root for the topmost line at which 
herb bushes usually appear (barring any digging) and repeat every seven lines. BTW, if 
you are like me in never remembering which beneficial herbs are paired with demon daisies 
and devil's roses, remember the "a" in "daisy" matches the "a"'s in "alraunia" and the 
"o" in "rose" matches the "o" in "mancox." Kinda cheesy, but it works.

On a standard 80x25 character screen, there are fifteen lines on which floors and dungeon 
features may appear, yielding two complete repetitions of the pattern with a bonus line 
of morgia root at the bottom. Lines 4, 20, and 21 may be burrowed to yield floors there 
too, and herb bushes can grow into these lines once dug out if their growth patterns 
permit it. If you play on a larger screen, use the "l"ook command to count down the line 
number of a given herb bush, keeping in mind that the "look" cursor's topmost limit is 
line 3, which would be stomafillia according to the pattern.

It is sometimes possible to move herb bushes to the lines you want in order to get a 
particularly desirable herb. You need four herb bushes in a "T" shape, like this (again, 
view it in a monospaced font):

...
"""
.".

When it's time for new bushes to grow, you'll get this pattern. . .

.".
"""
"""

. . . pick the bottom row clean. . .

.".
"""
...

. . . and wait for another generation to pass. . .

"""
"""
.".

Then harvest the bottom bush of each column to oblivion.

"""
.".
...

Voila! The T has moved up a row. You can also use an inverted T to move downward, or T's 
laid on their sides to move left or right. Once your T is in the position you want, just 
pluck off one end of the crossbar to get the ever-lovin' herb square. The process isn't 
risk-free, however. For one thing, generations of herb growth are not always predictable, 
and you may find two generations spawning in quick succession without giving you enough 
time in between to overharvest the needed bushes. Another note: do this in a locked room 
if you can. If you don't, the RNG *will* dump a wererat or a dark elven spider factory 
into your lap at an inoppurtune moment, leaving you to hack and slash through the bodies 
and miss perhaps several generations of herb growth.

As for the overall usefulness of each herb--well, reasonable minds will differ. Following 
are my own subjective opinions. Spenseweed, stomafillia, morgia root and moss of mareilon 
are the top four, with a definite gap in usefulness between them and curaria and alraunia, 
and another larger gap between those two and pepper petal. I personally rate spenseweed 
and stomafillia at the top because their utility never expires; you will *always* need 
healing and you will *always* need food, but the stat gain twins stop increasing your 
stats at a certain point. My non-troll characters go for spenseweed first, stomafillia 
second; for trolls, the priorities are reversed. If only the two grew on adjacent lines! 
Also, don't pass up the opportunity for a stat gain square, ever, unless you absolutely 
must choose between morgia root and spenseweed. Even then, morgia root *may* be the right 
choice, depending on how early it is (early game, pick morgia, late, pick spenseweed, 
middle is a toss-up), your race and class (mindcrafters and wizards love morgia, brawlers 
*need* spenseweed), and how low your stats are now.

In the middle tier, I prefer alraunia antidote in the *very* early game, as in the initial 
dive from the SMC to the mountain village before my first spider corpse. Once I'm no 
longer scared of pit vipers, my preference changes to curaria mancox so as to safely 
increase my Mana score by munching on kobold shaman. Last and in my mind least is pepper 
petal, which is inferior to spenseweed in almost every way. Spenseweed's use by rubbing 
instead of ingesting allows its use even while bloated, which will happen often if you're 
on the Blessed stomafillia Diet Plan (TM). Pepper petal has an evil twin; spenseweed 
doesn't. I've not observed any significant difference in healing potency between blessed 
pepper petal and blessed spenseweed, but as I often don't even bother to ID a bush I know 
will be pepper petal, I may have missed it. Some may argue that pepper petal is preferable 
to spenseweed for a starving character, but since stomafillia grows on the line above 
pepper petal--i.e. the two are often found together--I don't consider that a compelling 
argument.

Please note that, in those crucial beginning turns, *any* benefical herb (anything but the 
"evil twins") can save your life. If you see an herb bush by its lonesome, fated to die 
next generation anyway, then for heaven's sake, don't stop picking till you see the 
ground! Also, the Alchemy skill can add new wrinkles to prioritizing one's herbs. If you 
happen to know a recipe for a PoGA using only demon daisies and booze, then ignore the 
above paragraphs and GO FOR IT, MAN! Remember that success in the Drakalor Chain often 
comes not by memorizing a bunch of rules and patterns but by thinking on your feet!

knew you needed to know about herb bushes.

0.13.7 Shops

Shops are rooms in the dungeons inhabited by shopkeepers and stocked with their wares. 
Shops can be general stores selling a variety of items or specialty stores selling only 
one type of item. Shops should always be entered and explored, since viewing the items in 
a shop permanently identifies them. There are guaranteed shops in the game: Munxip's food 
store in Terinyo, Barnabas' shop in Lawenilothehl, Waldenbrook's shop in Dwarftown, 
Leggot's shop in the High Mountain Village and the Great Gift Shoppe in the Casino. 
Others are found randomly in the dungeons. Shopkeepers generally buy items as well as 
selling them. The exception is the Casino shop, which only sells. Specialty storekeepers 
are only interested in purchasing the items they specialize in. Sell Munxip those useless 
kobold corpses!

Shopkeepers will restock their inventory if it is depleted or appears to be depleted. It 
is a good idea to pick up everything in a shop and drop the unwanted items on one square. 
This gives the shopkeeper room to restock. Note that it is necessary for a certain amount 
of game time to pass in order for a shop to restock. PCs with sufficient Perception 
scores and Listening skill levels will hear a message "You hear arcane mumbling." which 
means a depleted shop has been restocked.

Shopkeepers have definite racial prejudices in addition to the special criteria Munxip 
(see sections 1.2.1.2, 1.2.1.3) and Barnabas (see section 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2) use. Malte 
Helmert has done some testing regarding this and observed the following: The HMV and 
Lawenilothehl shops were generated 50 times each. The races of the shopkeepers were:

Barnabas: 15x Human, 14x Orc, 13x Troll, 8x Gnome
Leggot: 18x Human, 14x Troll, 9x Gnome, 9x Dwarf

Other races may be possible, with a very low probability.

Quoting Malte's findings:

"The following chart lists the percentage of the "base value" offered by a shopkeeper of 
the race specified in the column to a PC of the race specified in the row. 100% is normal, 
110% is possible if the shopkeeper likes the PC's race very much (mostly if both are of 
the same race), and the value can become as low as 10% if the shopkeeper really hates the 
PC's race.

"Looking at the chart, you see that all non-Hurthling shopkeepers prefer PCs of the same 
race. Hurthlings are the only shopkeeper race that isn't prejudiced, and Hurthlings are 
also the best-liked PC race (there is no race that gives Hurthlings a really bad deal, and 
many give them excellent deals).

"Considering the fact that the most important shopkeeper in the game is a Dwarf 
[Waldenbrook - AW], Orcish and especially Dark Elven PCs appear to have the worst time 
(this is not news, of course)."

Shops can be robbed. This of course has effects on alignment, in addition to putting the 
PC's life at risk. These shopkeepers are maintaining a business in a highly dangerous 
enviroment and are well suited to dealing with those who choose to steal from them. In 
addition to their own very tough nature, they can summon hordes of thugs who attack the 
PC. Shopkeepers are able to detect invisible PCs. The message "-Shopkeeper- stares at 
your position with great intensity." indicates they have detected and are looking at an 
invisible PC. However, this does not happen instantly. Therefore, invisibility can be 
used to rob shops without making the shopkeeper hostile. The PC can enter a shop while 
invisible and pick up items. Anything the invisible PC picks up *prior* to generation of 
the above message can be taken from the shop safely. Therefore, the usual technique is to 
enter the shop while visible, gather up everything in the shop and drop it all as close 
to the door as possible. The PC can then become invisible, pick up everything and leave 
the shop undetected as long as the above message is not generated.

Another technique for robbing shops is available for those PCs who have pets or slaves 
under good control. If a shop is entered and nothing is picked up, the shopkeeper does 
not block the door. The PC can order his pet or slave to stand in the doorway, pick up 
whatever is desired, then :s swap positions with the pet or slave. At that point, getting 
away with the loot is simply a matter of outrunning the shopkeeper and avoiding or 
killing any summoned thugs.

A PC with the Teleportation spell can teleport a shopkeeper out of his shop. Shopkeepers 
are teleportation resistant, so trying this with a wand is usually not successful and a 
waste of the wand's charges.  This results in a hostile shopkeeper and summoned thugs, 
however.  Since it is impossible to choose the destination of the shopkeeper, this is a 
dangerous technique unless the PC is experienced enough to deal with a hostile shopkeeper 
and the thugs he will summon.


0.13.8 Rivers

Introduced in gamma 14, these can be found in the High Kings cave, puppy cave, druid 
dungeon, CoC, ID, UD (Rift?). Like any body of water, they can rust unprotected iron items, 
drench scrolls and spellbooks and drown the PC. Precautions include waterproof blankets, 
a high Swimming skill, water breathing gear (see section 0.12.7), rustproofing iron items 
and freezing the water.


0.13.9 Pools

Drinking from pools can do various magical things to a PC: one can gain or lose *any* 
intrinsic or unnatural aging. It is very possible to be corrupted by drinking from pools. 
Also, hostile snakes or water elementals can come out of pools. The most hunted-for 
ability of pools is the small chance of getting a wish. It has been said that pools with 
the color of the PC's eyes are the most beneficial.


 You feel altered in an eerie way.     Only happens with the pool in the

 Your senses sharpen                    Perception               You seem to get less perceptive

These messages also occur at other times when stats change, for example when gaining an 
experience level or encountering a stat-draining monster.

About a half-dozen pools are guaranteed to be found in Darkforge.


0.13.10 Forges

Forges are the basic pre-requisite for smithing - you also need an anvil, an item to 
improve, a hammer and an ingot of the appropriate metal.

A forge is near-guaranteed to be found in the UD, and guaranteed places to find some 
include Dwarftown and Darkforge.


0.13.11 Hives

Hives are holes in the floor of the dungeon containing hive creatures, either ants or 
bees. Their population is finite. There is a guaranteed ant hive on level two of the 
puppy cave.


0.13.11.1 Ants

Ant hives are simply a source of monsters to be killed with no particular reward 
associated with clearing the hive. Bear in mind that ants dig. Leaving them alone and 
allowing them to dig can be exploited as a source of rocks and possibly gems.

Huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills.  When an ant attempts to 
leave an anthill covered by a huge rock, the message "The uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6) 
seems to be shaking." is generated. Eventually the huge rock is destroyed ("Something 
from below destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!") and ants can come out of the 
hole again. Sometimes this happens after only a few turns, sometimes it takes more than 
a hundred. Multiple huge rocks are destroyed one after another and thus last longer 
than a single one.


0.13.11.2 Bees

Bee hives are filled with giant bee workers, giant bee warriors and a queen bee. They are 
a source of beeswax, which can be used to plug the PCs ears. This deafens the PC and is 
one way to survive the Banshee level. A bee hive is guaranteed to be generated before the 
Banshee's level. They are also a potential source of gelee royal, which when eaten has a 
variety of beneficial effects: it is very nourishing, heals, increases Appearance and 
cures poisoning. All of these beneficial effects will not be experienced simultaneously, 
of course. Bees have a poisonous attack, which kills the attacking bee. Kicking the hive 
will cause the bees to become enraged and swarm the PC. Kicking the hive apparently 
increases the chance of gelee royal generation, although it is not guaranteed.  Currently 
(in ADOM 1.1.1), bees generated by kicking the hive are considered summoned and therefore 
cannot be sacrificed. This may well be a bug. Be careful of this if you are relying on an 
altar to get rid of bees.


0.13.12 Special rooms and their effects

Courtesy of Bartalak with contributions by FoxRedlum and the newsgroup


0.13.12.1 Permanent effects

Strange lights flicker in this room.
- squares adjacent to the PC will be lit and darkened, changing with every turn
- the Light and Darkness spells do not have their usual permanent effect in these rooms

This seems to be a very dull room.
- this room abuses the Learning stat if stayed in too long
- almost no monsters or items are generated in this room (?)

The floor of this room seems to be very sticky.
- the energy points cost to move is increased by 30%

There seems to be a shifting breeze in this room.
- missile to-hit bonus is reduced by 2/3

The floor of this room is covered with puddles of ancient dried blood.
- bleeding is increased

You get the odd feeling that something is wrong with your perception of this room, 
but can't seem to tell what it is from just looking around.
- the direction for spells, pick pockets and kicking is reversed

This room seems to be filled with a deadly and chilling silence. All sounds are muffled.
- normal monster hits receive a large multiplier, causing many instakills

The air of this room is filled with the smell of carrots.

The air of this room is filled with a very rich flavor.
- satiation level does not go down (the PC doesn't get hungry)

There has been a recent report (4/24/2002) that satiation values do indeed decrease in 
rich flavor rooms, albeit very slowly. A bard who had won the game attempted to read a 
spellbook of Wish in a rich flavor room and failed due to the onset of starvation. After 
eating a blessed stomfillia at the Very Hungry stage, the same bard was able to read the 
spellbook. More details are needed, but it seems that food consumption rate is not reduced 
to zero in these rooms.

The air of this room refreshes you and sharpens your spirits!
- increases healing rate

The walls of this room are made of many small stones of uniform height; they almost look 
 like shelves of books.

Upon entering this room you feel a strange magical shock!
- pp is reduced to 0

Images of books and comfortable chairs line the walls. Suddenly the images fade away!
- -1 St, +1 Le

The walls have mirrors with many distortions of your image. You can't stand the sight of 
 your warped self. All the mirrors shatter!
- -1 Pe. If you are very low on hp you can be killed by the shattering.

A variation of these messages:
The walls have mirrors with many distortions of your image. You look great in all of them. 
 All the mirrors shatter!
This was a gray elven barbarian with Ap=20. Charisma was raised from 4 to 5 with no other 
 effect. Other elven PCs have seen the same effect with Ap=19.

The breeze accompanying you causes some ancient bones on the floor to transform into dust. 
You feel a sense of relief.
- apparently restores a few hit points

This room looks like a spa with a mud bath. You are hit in the face by a glob of hot mud! 
Suddenly everything disappears!

- blinds the PC, lowers appearance by 1. Wipe the PC's (F)ace, to raise the PC's appearance 
by 2 for a net gain of 1.

UNKNOWN:

You notice a pale fading ball of light upon entering this room. It quickly disappears.

You hear an eerie wail for a few seconds...

You hear a strange "*TCHUNK*" in your vicinity.
- Reported as meaningless by disassembly of the executable.

A rat scurries between your feet and disappears in a small hole in the ground.

For a few seconds you see a looming shade before you. It points its hand towards you in a 
threatening manner! Then it disappears.


0.13.13 Vaults

Vaults are large rooms, larger than tension rooms. Depending on the variety, they can be 
nearly completely filled with monsters or only partially filled. They vary in danger from 
moderate (a lesser vault full of gnolls and hyenas), a challenge for PCs less than 
experience level ten, to absolutely deadly (a greater vault full of greater undead), a 
challenge for experience level 50 PC's who have already won the game.


0.13.13.1 Lesser vaults

Lesser vaults generally take up about 1/4 of the screen with an 80 x 25 display. They 
come in every imaginable flavor, from gnolls and hyenas to lesser undead to a variety of 
berserkers. Their danger level is relatively low, comparable to a mixed tension room on 
the same level. There is a guaranteed lesser vault on the bottom level of the Puppy Cave 
if you want to see one quickly. The level message "You feel excited." is always generated 
when the PC enters a dungeon level containing a lesser vault.

Here is one possible layout of PC: 6 showing the guaranteed lesser vault in the upper 
right portion of the dungeon level:

0.13.13.2 Greater vaults

Greater vaults are unmistakable. They take up half of a standard dungeon level. The level 
message "You feel truly excited." is always generated when the PC enters a dungeon level 
containing a greater vault. It is wise to immediately zap a wand of Monster Detection to 
determine the type of vault. They come in a variety of types, including fire creatures 
(fire lizards, red dragons, ancient red dragons, ancient red wyrms), black dragons, white 
dragons, giants (hill giants, frost giants, fomorian giants), undead (vampires, ghosts, 
ghost lords, emperor lichs) and karmics (karmic lizards, karmic dragons, ancient karmic 
dragons). Greater undead and karmic greater vaults are particularly challenging. Some 
players will simply ignore greater vaults of greater undead, even with experience level 
50 PCs. This is despite the fact that the rewards for clearing a greater vault are 
considerable. They generally contain one or two artifacts along with substantial amounts 
of gold, usually well over 100000 gold pieces. This is in addition to any equipment that 
the monsters might drop, which is considerable in the case of a greater vault full of 
dragons. The amount of experience points available from clearing a greater vault is also 
huge.

PCs using good effectivity Frost Bolt or Fire Bolt generally have a fairly easy time 
clearing fire- or cold-based creatures, respectively. However, these ranged spells also 
destroy some of the equipment dropped by the monsters. High level Mindcrafters also have 
a relatively easy time with greater vaults (as long as they are not undead!). Casting 
Confusion Wave followed by (Greater) Mental Wave will clear a vault quickly, no muss, no 
fuss and no equipment destruction. Clearing a greater vault with a pure fighter is much 
more tedious.

Here is an example of a greater vault in the left half of D: 44. It contained fire 
creatures:

Note that this map displays an almost guaranteed feature of greater vaults - hidden 
rooms. Directly to the north of the PC is a 1 x 3 space. This was originally a hidden 
door and a 1 x 2 room containing a monster guarding an artifact, now lying on the floor. 
To the east is a fomerly secret 1 x 1 room. On the other side of the vault are two 
additional formerly secret rooms. The three that did not contain an artifact each 
contained 30,000+ gold pieces.

Greater fire creature vaults are not always in this configuration. The hidden rooms vary 
in location according to the layout.

More greater vault layouts:


This particular greater vault does not contain small hidden rooms, although the doorway 
into the central chamber is initially hidden.

[%(*}* items. There is a very good chance of finding an artifact in the inner room.

0.13.14 Royal treasuries

Royal treasuries are small hidden rooms generally found in the upper parts of the CoC. 
Their presence is indicated by the "You hear the steps of the royal guard." or "You hear 
the sound of falling coins." level messages. They are disconnected from the rest of the 
rooms on the level and thus can only be enterd by tunneling or teleportation. The royal 
guard within will not be hostile towards PCs that simply pick up the gold. Attacking the 
royal guard is not really worthwhile. It does not curse or doom, but is a chaotic act. 
Note that eating the corpse of a royal guard curses the PC.


0.13.14 Danger levels and top trap types

By Dayid Byron

Numbering the traps per the list in the GB:

0 Light trap
1 Corruption trap
2 Stone block trap
3 Alarm
4 Arrow trap
5 Acid trap
6 Pit - this pit is distinct from the other in that it contains vipers
7 Spear trap
8 Teleportation trap
9 Water trap
10Fireball trap
11Pit - simple pit, no vipers

In the list the first number is the danger level, then the top trap
type number.  For any Caverns of Chaos levels the danger level equals
the dungeon level and the top trap type is equal to (level x 5) -1

So, for example, on D:1 the trap that you would find in the top left
hand corner of the screen, if you could get there and make one, is
an arrow trap (trap number 4).  Within these lists the ttt just increases
by 5 each time.

(xx) The false Minotaur levels have a danger level equal to the 
equivalent real Minotaur level.  ie between 26 and 31.  Their
ttt varies.  The progression of the table above does hold, but
since you can't tell one false level from another other than by ttt
I didn't think it was worth writing them down.  I've not seen
14 false Minotaur levels.  There is space for 14 but I've only
seen 12 so far.  If 12 is the maximum there are only 172 locations.


0.14 Tips and tricks


0.14.1 Recharging wands

There are many ways to recharge a depleted wand. The common ways are to dip the wand 
into an appropriate potion or read a scroll of charging.  Only the type of potion and 
its status affects the number of charges. The type, status and rusy/nonrusty nature of 
the wand do not matter.

Some results compiled by Petri Sihvola:

Potion or scroll      Status      Trials   Average charges   Min/Max charges

Boost mana            Blessed       60           5.8               3/9
                      Uncursed      60           3.9               2/6
                      Cursed        60           1.9               1/3

                      Cursed        60           1.5               1/2

                      Cursed        60           2.7               1/4

Potions of raw mana do *not* work.  Note that potions of mana can be used to permanently 
increase the PCs mana stat; the player may want to save them for that purpose.

Wizards can also recharge wands at level 32, only once per wand though.

Wands of wishing can't be recharged. For these, you'll want to use the chance to wrench 
a final charge from the wand, destroying it.

See also potions of raw chaos below.


0.14.2 Huge rocks and anvils

These heavy items have a nice use: crashing doors. Throw one at a door and enjoy the 
sight of a broken door before you. There is a very nice side benefit to this: any trap 
that the door was protected with is destroyed along with the door. The trap does not go 
off as it is destroyed.

Huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills. Whenever an ant wants to 
escape, you get a message like "The uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6) seems to be 
shaking.". Eventually the huge rock is destroyed ("Something from below destroys the 
uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!") and ants can come out of the hole again. Sometimes 
this happens after only a few turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple 
huge rocks are destroyed one after the other and thus last longer than a single one.


0.14.3 Statues

If your PC is really, really buff, a statue can be wielded as a melee weapon, but the 
real use for statues is to kick it until it breaks down, making it yield a magical wand. 
Statues can be generated by petrifying enemies.

Stephen White has done some research on the b/u/c status of statues re wand generation. 
His PC kicked 200 statues with each status to pieces. The results were as follows:

Blessed statues: 62 wands generated, about 1/3
Uncursed statues: 17 wands generated, about 1/10
Cursed statues: 3 wands generated, about 1/100


0.14.4 Potions of raw chaos

Items can be dipped in potions of raw chaos in order to transform them into new ones. 
Dipping items (other than artifacts) into a PoRC will transform it into a random item of 
the same type - useful for brass items. Equipped items are removed (even if cursed) and 
cursed. There is a chance of spilling the potion, though, and this badly corrupts the PC, 
about 4 corruptions, and causes 100 - 200 HP of damage.  Needless to say, this can kill 
a low-level PC.  Never drink these!

Wands dipped into a PoRC will turn into a wand with a different number of charges. This 
is one way to recharge wands with 0 charges left. The type of wand, however, is 
unpredictable.

Potions of raw chaos can be created by dipping any corrupting artifact (those containing 
the essence of chaos and corruption + Moon Sickle) into any ordinary potion.


0.14.5 Potions of exchange

In addition to swapping stats, these can polymorph monsters, and items, to another type.


0.14.6 Regeneration of HP and PP: potions of troll blood and raw mana

When drinking potions of insight or casting the Revelation spell, there
is some information about Power Point and Hit Point regeneration.

Those two values lie between 5 and 200, the lower the number, the faster the
regeneration. They can be affected by drinking potions of troll blood
(for hit points) or potions of raw mana (for power points). Their
effectiveness depends on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:

Item Status   Modification to Regneration Rate

blessed       -8 (on average, effect varies)
uncursed      -4 (on average, effect varies)
cursed        +4 (on average, effect varies)

Bottom line: always bless your potions of troll blood or raw mana.

HP regeneration time

standard value:          50 - the value for humans and hurthlings
Dark Elves:             +20
Gray Elves:             +15
High Elves:             +10
Gnomes:                 -2
Dwarves:                -5
Orcs:                   -10
Drakelings:             -20
Trolls:                 -30
Healers:                 halved
most characters:        -1 (based on Toughness?)
some characters:        -1 once more (based on Toughness?)

The modifiers are applied in the order listed here.
E.g. Trollish Healers with exceptional toughness get a starting
regeneration time of (50 - 30) / 2 - 1 - 1 = 8.

It seems like the last to -1 modifiers are based on toughness, but there
does not seem to be an obvious relationship; a random element may be 
involved as well.

PP regeneration time

standard value:          50 - the value for humans and drakelings
Trolls:                 +50
Dwarves:                +40
Hurthlings:             +10
Orcs:                   +5
High Elves:             -10
Gnomes:                 -10
Dark Elves:             -20
Gray Elves:             -25
most characters:        -1 (based on Mana?)
some characters:        -1 once more (based on Mana?)

How regeneration works

The PC always receives one HP/PP once the appropriate time has passed. 
Healing/Concentration will regenerate additional points at random 
intervals.

Regenerative capabilties from these sources are additive.

HP gained by Healing in 100 turns (approximately):

no Healing:       0
Skill Level 10:   0.8
Skill Level 20:   1.6
...
Skill Level 100:  8.0


HP gained naturally in 100 turns:

standard character (1 HP/50):   2.0
1 HP/40:                        2.5
1 HP/30:                        3.3
1 HP/20:                        5.0
1 HP/10:                       10.0
1 HP/5:                        20.0

As can be seen, many blessed potions of troll blood will get you more
than good healing skill, but having Healing at 100 is best.

For regaining PP naturally, the same values apply. However, 
Concentration is better than Healing since it grants more points than 
Healing.  The value is also increased even more at specific points 
mentioned in the manual. Since there does not seem to be an obvious model 
for this, the values are simply listed:

PP gained by Concentration in 100 turns (approximately):

no Concentration:   0
Skill Level 50:    10.96
Skill Level 74:    13.84
Skill Level 75:    26.86 x2
Skill Level 89:    32.42
Skill Level 90:    43.18 x4/3
Skill Level 99:    46.48
Skill Level 100:   59.00 x5/4

So potions of raw mana are nice, but not as important as having a high
Concentration skill.

There don't seem to be any corruptions influencing mana regeneration.
Neither mana battery nor close attunement to astral space have any effect.

Regeneration occurs at the same rate whether walking around or resting. 
Regeneration time is measured in *turns* (at least for simple actions like 
walking, fighting or resting), not game time. High speed or seven league 
boots lead to exactly the same regeneration rate in turns. Thus regeneration 
is faster with respect to game time if the PC is fast or walking around with 
seven league boots. If a PC with low walking energy cost wants to spend the 
minimum amount of game time regenerating, the best bet is to walk around 
while regenerating.

The Cursed, Doomed, Lucky and Fate Smiles intrinsics do not make a
difference for regeneration purposes.

Hunger status has no effect on regeneration.

Trolls have food consumption doubled.
Monks have food consumption halved.
Farmers have food consumption halved starting from level 12.

Things that are still missing and interesting to investigate:
* Information about corpses (trolls and the like for HP regeneration,
  maybe some creatures for PP regeneration)
* the effect of the starsign of Candle
* the effect of items (such as necklaces of rapid healing)
* the effect of the corrupted tissue corruption
* the effect of being burdened/strained/very strained/overburdened on
  regeneration and food consumption
* the effect of artifacts carried and worn on food consumption
* information about the various special rooms that affect regeneration


0.14.6.1 Troll corpses

Thanks to Malte Helmert for this section.

There are four types of troll corpses (troll, troll berserker, troll 
chief, troll king). They all yield either of two messages when eaten by 
a non-troll:

a) "Urg! Foul meat! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
b) "Urg! Foul meat!"

Message a) indicates that HP regeneration time decreased by one
Message b) indicates that HP regeneration time did not change

For troll PCs, the messages are slightly modified:

a') "Yum! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
b') "Yum!"

The behaviour is the same: a' decreases HP regeneration time, b' does not.

No corpse can reduce the regeneration time below 6. Trying this always 
gives message b) or b'), respectively. This differs from potions of 
troll blood, which always result in the "Your blood suddenly curses 
faster..." message, even if the regeneration time is already minimal. 
Note that the lower threshold is 6, unlike the threshold for potions of 
troll blood, which is 5. This means that trolls, who cannot make use of 
potions of troll blood, cannot lower their regeneration time to 5, 
unlike the other races.

The probabilities of getting a decrease in regeneration time depends 
only on the B/U/C status of the corpse. Specifically, it does not 
depend on:
* Current regeneration time (no difference between the lowest 
eligible value 7 and the unrealistically high value 300)
* Player race (human vs. troll)
* Cooked/uncooked status
* Type of troll corpse (troll, troll berserker, troll chief, troll king)

Results indicate that blessed corpses work in 100% of the cases 
(although, like all corpses, they cannot lower it below 6), and uncursed 
or cursed corpses work in 50% of the cases. There was no observable 
difference between uncursed and cursed corpses:

94 blessed troll corpses: 94x decrease
621 uncursed troll corpses: 314x decrease, 307x no decrease
361 cursed troll corpses: 187x decrease, 174x no decrease

There was no difference in weight or satiation value of the various kinds 
of troll corpses. All corpses weigh 240s if not cooked, irrespective of 
B/U/C (rotting) status, and 228s (= 5% less) if cooked, again irrespective 
of B/U/C (rotting) status.

An uncursed corpse yields 500 units of satiation (like a large ration). 
This is doubled if the corpse is cooked (presumably this holds for other 
corpses too, but this needs further verification). The resulting value 
is modified by +25% for blessed corpes and -50% for cursed corpses, just 
like for other food items. So, e.g. a blessed cooked troll chief corpse 
gives 500 * 2 * 1.25 = 1250 units of satiation.

SUMMARY

Item: [troll/troll berserker/troll chief/troll king] corpse
Weight: 240s (-5% if cooked)
Nutritional value: 500 (*2 if cooked, *1.25 if blessed, *0.5 if cursed)
Effect when eaten [blessed]: If HP regeneration time is >= 7, it is 
reduced by 1
Effect when eaten [uncursed/cursed]: If HP regeneration time is >= 7, it 
is reduced by 1 with a probability of 50%
Message when eaten [non-troll PC]: "Urg! Foul meat!"
Message when eaten [troll PC]: "Yum!"
Additional message if and only if HP regeneration time was reduced: 
"Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"


0.14.7 Freezing water

Pretty straightforward: use some cold source while standing next to a water square and 
zap over it. Frost/Nether Bolt, Ice Ball/Freezing Fury, or a wand of cold qualify. Ice 
is fragile, of course, and there's a 2000 stone limit for your stuff's weight.  
Exploding ice vortices will freeze all water in the range of their blast.  Likewise, 
monsters that cast Frost Bolt, Ogre Magi for instance, can freeze water.  However, 
monsters that breathe ice, white dragons for example, do not freeze anything when their 
breath crosses water (probably a bug).


0.14.8 Safe places to store items

Locked rooms

Locked rooms are one of the safest places to leave items in ADOM.  With the current 
state of the monster inventory system (they can pick up items but not use them), a 
monster will never be able to unlock a door.  Several monsters can smash doors, however.  
Some monsters (balors spring to mind) can teleport into locked rooms.

The Old Barbarian's glade

The Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items. He is the only monster ever 
generated in this location, so nothing randomly generated is going to run away with the 
PC's stuff. If the PC leaves items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will not have time 
to find them prior to the PC's next visit.

The Mad Minstrel's clearing

In ADOM 1.0.0, the Mad Minstrel will leave his hut, and will pick up items.  The safety 
re storage is therefore similar to the Old Barbarian's glade.  No other monsters are 
generated in his clearing, so leaving items far away from the Mad Minstrel should not 
allow him time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.

The Dwarven Mystic's room in Dwarftown

The ultimate in security, if the PC has not destroyed it with a wand of destruction (see 
section 2.5.4). After 'C'hatting wih the Dwarven Mystic, he disappears, leaving a 2 x 2 
room that cannot be entered except by teleportation. Since there are no teleporting 
monsters found in Dwarftown (except for the greater daemon - kill it) this is as safe as 
storage areas get.  Other Dwarftown inhabitants  can, in extremely rare circumstances, be 
generated in this room.  Since they will be nonhostile, killing them is not a good idea.  
Teleport them out if possible.  Alternatively, use the Ogre Cave (see below).

The Ogre Cave in Dwarftown

Once the Ogre Cave is cleared, monster generation there is slow or nonexistent.  Items 
can be left adjacent to the stairway.  If the PC leaves immediately, no time passes on 
the level, so there should be almost no chance the items will be disturbed.

The secret room in the HMV

Another room accessible only by teleportation, therefore almost perfect theoretical 
security. A monster teleporting into this room has never been seen.

Sharad-Waador's room

Items left in Sharad-Waador's room never seem to be disturbed. Sharad-Waador never moves 
from the square where he is initially generated (unless he is attacked or the PC reneges 
on the deal to take the quest), and no time passes on the level between the PC's departure 
and reemergence from the blue dragon caves. This is very important, since the player may 
want to leave important non-artifact equipment behind in order to avoid its potential 
destruction in the blue dragon caves (see section 3.9).


0.14.9 Seven league boots

Seven league boots can dramatically reduce the time needed to walk around in the 
wilderness, depending on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:

blessed: time needed for walking is divided by 6
uncursed: time needed for walking is divided by 3
cursed: time needed for walking is multiplied by 2

Blessed/uncursed/cursed seven league boots also alter the base energy cost for movement 
outside the wilderness from 1000 to 500/750/1200, respectively. Seven league boots should 
be blessed immediately. They enable the PC to outrun anything other than quicklings.  
Consequently, some players regard seven league boots as the most important item in the 
game, and will use a wish to obtain them, if necessary.


0.14.10 Stethoscopes

'U'sing a stethoscope, you can determine a monster's statistics precisely. Furthermore, 
using a stethoscope, you can easily find secret doors: scan a wall block, and if it 
"sounds hollow", it's a secret door.

In addition to monsters and secret doors, stethoscopes can also be used on closed doors 
to find out the number of monsters behind it. The messages are:

"Silence." - corridor

(this message is shown even if the corridor is full of monsters, so be warned)

"You hear nothing." - empty room

"You hear some low-volume sounds." - 1 monster in the room

"You hear some sounds." - 2-3 monsters

"You hear many sounds." - 4-8 monsters

"You hear lots of sounds." - 9 or more monsters (tension rooms and rooms filled with 
                               breeders or summoned creatures also give this message)

See section 0.14.11 below concerning a Healer's special ability with stethoscopes.


0.14.11 Undocumented character abilities

All characters gain to-hit and to-damage bonuses when fighting as a true berserker, which 
means no armor can be worn and Tactics must be set to berserk. Shields are acceptable, 
any worn armor is not. Level 40 and higher barbarians get additional bonuses on top of 
this when fighting as a true berserker.

Note that Monks do not seem to receive this true berserker bonus.

Monks gain the ability to kick down walls at experience level 13.

Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings, scrolls, or wands. This 
specialization allows them to identify any item in that category on sight.  Merchants also 
have a unique ability to use coins as missiles (in ADOM 1.0.0, dopplegangers cannot 
deflect a merchant's thrown coins).

Healers have the ability to use a stethoscope without consuming any game time.  All other 
classes consume one turn of game time when using a stethoscope.


0.14.12 The weight and appearance of objects

Note the weight of objects. Many valuable objects have a unique weight. For instance, 
there is only one type of sword with a weight of 35s, one amulet weighing 7s, one amulet 
weighing 8s, one girdle weighing 30s, etc. In general, lighter items are better. Items 
with odd, unusual or rare weights are often better than their more commonly observed 
counterparts.

Certain special items are also have a unique color. Slaying quarrels will be brown rather 
than the silver of normal quarrels. Metal-shod quarterstaves (whether iron-, mithril-, 
adamantium- or eternium-) are silver; normal quarterstaves are brown. This is especially 
important to remember for eternium-shod quarterstaves, since they have the same weight as 
wooden quarterstaves.

0.14.13 Fortune cookies, rumors and the babblings of Yggaz

Rumors in general are available from several sources: fortune cookies found randomly in 
the dungeons, beggars, Torgall the innkeeper in Dwarftown, the book The Collected Works 
of Confucious and Yggaz the fool in Terinyo. Yggaz also regularly spews what seems to be 
complete nonsense; it is included at the end of the list below. There is also a special 
room effect where a mouth will appear on a wall and deliver a fortune cookie message.

A chaos creature's corpse will yield a potion of cure corruption from
Guth'Alak, but being attacked by corrupting chaos creatures is very nasty.

True (see section 2.22).

140. They say that you need persistence and peace to truly profit from religious scriptures.

Tracts are buggy, nobody benefits from them. The "persistence and peace" probably refers to the fact that tracts are difficult to read, so the PC must not be disturbed by monsters. Interestingly, however, teleportitis does not bother PCs trying to read tracts.

141. They say that you need to be an expert climber to survive the great rift.

Climbing 100 is required.

142. They say that you need to be very experienced to enter the great rift.

The PC must be a champion of Order or Balance.

167. To be heavy is not very nifty in a deep rift.

Even worse than normal.

168. Ye dost not need to find some kind of amulet to save the world.

Reference to the original Rogue and its descendants.

169. Your termination is long due.

Right. So is the termination of this list.

Yggaz's babbling:

1. A lord might come, he will kill some, others he will beat and that will be neat.

Starting a game on...                    results in the message...                     and has the following effects... 
---------------------                    -------------------------                     --------------------------------
Creator's Day (TB's birthday, July 2nd)  You feel that starting your adventure on      PC starts with Lucky and Fate Smiles; 
                                         Creator's Day was a good idea.                also, if the day falls on a Monday, 
                                                                                       HP are not reduced.
Christmas Eve (December 24th)            A lone star leads you to this remote valley.  PC starts with Fate Smiles. 
New Year's Eve (December 31st)           You feel well prepared for the coming year.   PC starts with six blessed potions of booze.
Any Friday the 13th                      You feel unlucky.                             PC starts Cursed.
Any Monday                               You feel slightly exhausted today.            PC starts slightly low on HP.


There are of course Ancardian day and date effects as well, which are well covered in 
the manual.

   --- STARTING TALENTS --- (all these have a prerequisite of Level 1)

Note that you only start with 1-6 talents. Since several of the
STARTING TALENTS are prerequisites, you need to consider your choice 
of Level 1 talents very carefully. Since a +Attribute talent is 
worth half a (blessed) potion of Attribute, it's probably only
worthwhile to take them as prerequisites if needed. Some +Attribute
talents, however, can be quite useful for early-game survival, and
should be considered.

   ALERT -- +1 to Perception.
   Prerequisites: Level 1. 

Rating: 3 (4 for archers)
Prerequisite for: Treasure Hunter(9), Missile Weapon Master(3-7)

Prerequisite for Missile Weapon Master and Treasure Hunter. Treasure
Hunter is generally accepted to be one of the most desirable (if not
_the_ most desirable) talents, making Alert a populer Level 1 choice.
See Missile Weapon Master for a discussion on viability.
If you don't want Treasure Hunter or Missile Weapon Master, Alert is
of marginal utility; Perception is one of the less useful attributes,
and is fairly easily increased. A mid-range Perception score (12-18)
is a prerequisite for a number of talents, none of them very useful,
except possibly Great Book Caster.
Note that this talent is slightly more useful if you play ADOM on 
higher than 80x25 resolutions.

   CHARMING -- +1 to Charisma.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1 (2 for male characters and Bards)
Prerequisite for: Heir(3-10)

Prerequisite for Heir. If you don't have at least 3 starting talents,
or if you simply don't want Heir, this talent is next to useless.
While Charisma is not particularly easy to raise, it's almost 
completely useless for everyone except Bards (for whom it is of
medium importance).
Charisma is a prerequisite for Silver Tongue and Natural Trader,
neither of which is worth getting, either.

   DEXTROUS -- +1 to Dexterity.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 3

Not a prerequisite and probably not worth it. Dexterity gives speed, 
DV, and missile weapon to-hit (and possibly damage, anyone know for
certain?), but Dextrous is a dead-end talent and the specialized
talents for speed, DV, and missile bonuses are much more powerful.
Dexterity is the prerequisite for a number of useful talents. None 
of them need above 18 Dex, though, and that shouldn't be too 
difficult to come by in the early-to-mid game.

   FEY-BLOODED -- +1 to Mana.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 3 (2 for non-spellcasters)

Not a prerequisite. Of some use to spellcasters with low mana 
scores (troll wizards, for example). If your starting Mana score 
is low, this might be somewhat helpful in reaching the prerequisites 
for the magical talents. Since Mana is probably the easiest 
attribute to train, however, I'd advise against taking this talent.

   GOOD LOOKS -- +1 to Appearance.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1 (2 for female characters)

Not a prerequisite, and a proufundly worthless talent. Appearance is 
the least useful attribute for anyone.

   LEARNED -- +1 to Learning.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 4 (5 for illiterate characters)

Not a prerequisite, and fairly easy to train for most characters.
Learning does help with a good number of things, but if your 
character automatically gets the Literacy skill, probably not worth 
it. Even if he/she doesn't, 1 point is unlikely to make a difference.

   STRONG -- +1 to Strength.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 4 (5-7 for melee characters)

Not a prerequisite. Strength can be trained very quickly at low 
levels, but slows down somewhat later. It is also one of the most
useful attributes for most characters. For this reason, melee
characters might possibly want to consider this talent.

   STRONG OF WILL -- +1 to Willpower.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 3 (4 for Mindcrafters)
Prerequisite for: Melee Weapon Master(5-7), Saint(2)

Prerequisite for Melee Weapon Master (and Saint, which is next to
usealess). If you don't want Melee Weapon Master, Willpower is of
medium-to-high importance (high for spellcasters, medium for everyone
else). It's easy to raise into the twenties by the early-to-mid game
(if you know how), though, making Strong of Will a bad choice except 
as a prerequisite.

   TOUGH -- +1 to Toughness.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 4

Not a prerequisite. Would be a fairly good choice if there wasn't a
reliable method of raising Toughness into the mid-twenties by the
early-to-mid game. Still might be worth considering for characters 
with a very low starting toughness, but the defensive talents are
overall probably better for early survival.

   WEALTHY -- Three times the normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.
 
   VERY WEALTHY -- Two times the normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Wealthy, Level 1.

   FILTHY RICH -- Two times the normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Very Wealthy, Level 1.

Rating: 1 (3 for Merchants)

These three talents are rather useless. All three of them 
together will only get you twelve times your starting money 
(or 24 times, with Boon to the Family), which only counts as 
a lot at the very beginning of the game. 
One exception: merchants with a lot of starting talents can 
actually get quite a lot of money with these talents, potentially
opening up several interesting options for them in the early game.
Overall, these talents are still probably a suboptimal choice.

   BOON TO THE FAMILY -- Twice normal starting money.
   Prerequisites: Level 1. 

Rating: 1
Prerequisite for: Heir(3-10)

A prerequisite for Heir. Otherwise even worse than Wealthy.

   HEIR -- Receives a special magical item inherited from his family.
   Prerequisites: Boon to the Family, Charming, Level 1. 

Rating: 3-10 (depending on class; 10 would be for Bards)

Has two prerequisites, which means you must have at least 3 starting
talents to get it. Its usefulness is strongly dependent on your class.
For Bards, the reward is approximately worth a Wish, and is one of
the most powerful items in the game. Heir gifts for other classes
will eventually become obsolete, but usually help with early-game 
survival a great deal. It's _three_ starting talents, though, so 
consider it carefully.

   SKILLED -- +2 to all initial skill values.
   Prerequisites: Learning 9+, Level 1.
 
   VERY SKILLED -- +3 to all initial skill values.
   Prerequisites: Skilled, Learning 12+, Level 1.

   EXTREMELY SKILLED -- +5 to all initial skill values.
   Prerequisites: Very Skilled, Learning 15+, Level 1.

Rating: 3

You can only get these talents if you have a decent Learning, 
which is precisely when you don't need them. At low levels,
skills go up fast. Leave these talents alone.
Note also that these talents are currently (ADOM 1.1.1) 
buggy and can crash the game if taken.

   LONG-LIVED -- the PCs life span is extended by 30%.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1-5 (Depending on race; 1 for elves, 5 for trolls)

PCs with short life spans might want to consider this. 30% is
not a lot overall, but might just be the bonus that saves your
life against Ghost Lords. It's a dead-end talent, though, so
consider it carefully.

   --- MELEE TALENTS ---

   AFFINITY WITH AXES -- +2 to hit with axes.
  
   AFFINITY WITH CLUBS & HAMMERS -- +2 to hit with clubs and hammers.

   AFFINITY WITH DAGGERS & KNIVES -- +2 to hit with daggers and
      knives.

   AFFINITY WITH MACES & FLAILS -- +2 to hit with maces and flails.

   AFFINITY WITH POLEARMS -- +2 to hit with polearms.

   AFFINITY WITH SWORDS -- +2 to hit with swords.

   AFFINITY WITH WHIPS -- +4 to hit with whips.

   AFFINITY WITH STAVES -- +2 to hit with staves.

   AFFINITY WITH TWOHANDED WEAPONS -- +2 to hit with twohanded
      weapons.

Rating: 6 (5 for spellcasters)
Prerequisite for: Melee Weapon Master (5-7)

If you want Melee Weapon Master, you must take three of these.
Otherwise, I suggest waiting until you're sure about what weapon(s)
you want to use in the long run; otherwise, it's a wasted talent.
+2 to hit is not a lot, but with the new ADOM combat system, you 
can never have too much (or even enough) of a to-hit bonus, and 
every little bit helps. The +4 for whips is nice, but still doesn't 
make whips worthwhile, generally speaking.

   MELEE WEAPON MASTER -- +3 to hit and damage in melee combat.
   Prerequisites: At least 3 melee weapon affinities, Defensive
   Fighter, Strong of Will

Rating: 7 (5 for spellcasters)

This is a very expensive talent: it has 7 prerequisites. Still,
since four of them (with the exceptions being Strong of Will and
two of the three affinities) are useful for a melee fighter, it's 
probably worth getting.
For spellcasters, DV and PV are much more important than to-hit
and damage, which makes Melee Weapon Master a less attractive 
proposition.

   BRAWLER -- +2 to hit in unarmed melee combat.
   Prerequisites: Strength 13+.

Rating: 1 (7 for Monks and Beastfighters)

Not a prerequisite. If you're playing an unarmed fighter, 
probably worth getting.

   STRONG LEGS -- Kicking in doors is much easier. +2 to kick damage.
   Prerequisites: Level 1.

Rating: 1 (4 for Monks)

Not a prerequisite. Useless for anyone but monks; you very rarely
need to kick down a door quickly. Since not even Monks kick much,
even after getting the circular kick ability, and the damage bonus
is not at all spectacular, it's probably best to ignore this talent.

Note that this talent may or may not help with kicking down walls
quickly, for a Monk of level 13 or above.

   AGGRESSIVE -- +1 to hit in melee.

Rating: 5 (2 for spellcasters)
Prerequisite for: Natural Berserker (4-8)

If you want Natural Berserker, you must get this. If you don't, 
you'd probably be better off with other combat talents. +1 is
not much at all.

   NATURAL BERSERKER -- +2 to hit and damage when berserking.
   Prerequisites: Aggressive.

Rating: 4 (may be 6-8, depending on playstyle).

Normally, one doesn't usually spend much time in Berserk mode, and
this talent isn't powerful enough to justify doing so. If, however,
you play a berserkering melee fighter, this can be a fairly powerful
talent.

   AMBIDEXTROUS -- +2 to hit when fighting with two weapons.

Rating: 6

Not a prerequisite. Probably a good idea to get it if you're planning
on fighting with two weapons.

   BASHER -- +1 to hit and damage with weapons weighing more than 
      100 stones.

   POWERFUL STRIKE -- +2 to hit and damage with weapons weighing more
      than 100 stones.
   Prerequisites: Basher, Strength 13+.

   MIGHTY STRIKE -- +3 to hit and damage with weapons weighing more
      than 100 stones.
   Prerequisites: Powerful Strike, Strength 18+.

Rating: 9 (situational, 6 for spellcasters)

Unfortunately, most worthwhile weapons are 100s or lighter. Even with
these talents, the only weapons that are worthwhile are maces of 
destruction and some artifacts. Also, some weapons with the "heavier-
than-normal" prefixes, as well as some non-higher-metal ego weapons, 
might fit into this category.
If you actually manage to get one of these weapons, these talents can
be _very_ worthwhile. It's definitely a gamble, though, and none of
them can even be wished for, except the mace of destruction. For this
reason, I suggest only getting these talents if you've actually found
one of the above weapons, or you know you'll get it (quite a few of
the artifacts that fit the bill are guaranteed, including, notably,
the ToTRR). Getting these talents eariler is a very risky gamble.

   --- MISSILE AND THROWN WEAPON TALENTS ---

   AFFINITY WITH BOWS -- +2 to hit with bows.

   AFFINITY WITH CROSSBOWS -- +2 to hit with crossbows.

   AFFINITY WITH SLINGS -- +2 to hit with slings.

   AFFINITY WITH BOOMERANGS & SCURGARI -- +4 to hit with thrown
      boomerangs and scurgari.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN DAGGERS -- +3 to hit with thrown daggers.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN AXES & HAMMERS -- +3 to hit with thrown axes
      and hammers.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN ROCKS & CLUBS -- +3 to hit with thrown rocks
      and clubs.

   AFFINITY WITH THROWN SPEARS -- +3 to hit with thrown spears.

Rating: 5 (4 for spellcasters, 7 for archers)
Prerequisite for: Missile Weapon Master(3-7)

If you want Missile Weapon Master, you must take three of these.
Otherwise, I suggest waiting until you're sure about what missile 
weapon(s) you want to use in the long run; otherwise, it's a wasted 
talent. Your to-hit bonus for missile weapons is less of a critical 
issue than for melee weapons, which is why these got a lesser score. 
For an archer, though, they're still very useful.

   GOOD SHOT -- +1 to hit and damage with missile weapons.

   KEEN SHOT -- +2 to hit and damage with missile weapons.
   Prerequisites: Good Shot, Dexterity 13+.

   EAGLE-EYED -- +3 to hit and damage with missile weapons.
   Prerequisites: Good Shot, Archery 80+, Dexterity 18+.

Rating: 6 (4 for spellcasters, 9 for archers)

These are excellent bonuses for an archer. Other characters will
want to consider how much they will be using missile weapons.
Note that Keen Shot is _not_ a prerequisite for Eagle-Eyed, just
for Missile Weapon Master. If you can, buy Eagle-Eyed first.

   MISSILE WEAPON MASTER -- +3 to hit and damage in missile combat.
   Prerequisites: At least 3 missile weapon affinities, Keen Shot,
   Alert

Rating: 5 (3 for spellcasters, 7 for archers)

This is the same as Eagle-Eyed, but much more expensive. It has 6
prerequisites, 3 of which (Alert and two of the three affinities)
are not very useful. Characters other than archers will probably
want to pass on this one.

   QUICK SHOT -- Missile attacks require 10% less energy.
   Prerequisites: Keen Shot, Quick.

   LIGHTNING SHOT -- Missile attacks require 10% less energy.
   Prerequisites: Quick Shot, Archery 60+.

Rating: 7 (9 for archers, 5 for pure spellcasters)

If you're planning on using missile weapons at all, the bonus
speed from these talents is excellent.

   FAR SHOT -- Missile attack ranges are increased by 20%.
   Prerequisites: Keen Shot, Strength 10+.

Rating: 2 (3 for archers)

If you're not going to be primarily using missile attacks, the
extra range isn't going to come into play much. If you are, then
you should have more than sufficient range from your weapon skill 
and the Archery skill. Avoid.

   STRONG THROWER -- +2 range with thrown weapons.
   Prerequisites: Strength 12+.

Rating: 2 (5 for throwers, 7 in special circumstances)

This is somewhat better than Far Shot (+2 range is usually better
than +20%; if not, then you really don't need to be increasing your
range anyway). It really becomes useful if you want to use unorthodox
throwing weapons like Hammer of the Gods or Long Sting. In those 
cases, the +2 range can actually be very useful. I suggest waiting
until you're sure that's what you want to do, and then considering
buying this talent.

   --- DEFENSIVE TALENTS ---

   CAREFUL -- +1 to DV.

Rating: 5 
Prerequisite for: Very Careful(4-7), Defensive Fighter(7), 
   Good Book Caster(5-8)

DV is very important for all classes in the mid-to-late game. +1 is
not much by itself, but Careful is a prerequisite for Very Careful, 
for the Defensive Fighter->Dodger chain, as well as for Good Book 
Caster. All great talents.

   VERY CAREFUL -- +3 to DV when fighting very defensively or like a
      coward.
   Prerequisites: Careful.

Rating: 4 (7 for spellcasters, may be 5-7 for others depending on
playing style)

Most players probably won't be fighting very defensively a lot, and 
this talent isn't good enough to make it worth doing so. If, however,
you're a spellcaster, or you generally fight at the Very Defensive
setting, this can be a useful bonus.

   DEFENSIVE FIGHTER -- +2 to DV.
   Prerequisites: Careful, Quick.

Rating: 7
Prerequisite for: Melee Weapon Master(5-7), Dodger(7)

+2 DV is nice for all classes. This is also a prerequisite for two
useful talents.

   DODGER -- +2 to DV.
   Prerequisites: Defensive Fighter, Dodge 75+

Rating: 7

Same as Defensive Fighter. Not a prerequisite for anything, though.

   SHIELD SPECIALIST -- +1 to DV when wielding a shield.

   SHIELD EXPERT -- +2 to DV when wielding a shield.
   Prerequisites: Shield Specialist, Shield Weapon Skill 3+

   SHIELD MASTER -- +3 to DV when wielding a shield.
   Prerequisites: Shield Expert, Shield Weapon Skill 6+

Rating: 7

These are only worth buying if you plan on getting all three. 
Otherwise, Careful and Defensive Fighter are probably better.
If you use a shield, though, these three give a +6 bonus to
DV, which is excellent.

   HARDY -- +3 hitpoints.
   Prerequisites: Toughness 10+.

Rating: 4
Prerequisite for: Very Hardy(4-7), Tough Skin(5-7)

Prerequisite for the 7 talents below. If don't want them, Hardy
probably isn't worth it; 3 hitpoints doesn't count for too much 
even in the early game, and quickly becomes negligible.

   VERY HARDY -- +6 hitpoints.
   Prerequisites: Hardy, Toughness 15+.

   EXTREMELY HARDY -- +9 hitpoints.
   Prerequisites: Very Hardy, Toughness 20+.

Rating: 4 (5-7 in the early game)

If you have a Toughness of 20 or more, 18 extra hitpoints aren't 
going to mean much, especially in the late game. Your talents would 
probably be better spent elsewhere. If you feel that the early game
is going to be the most difficult part for your character, though,
then these talents might just mean the difference between life and
death.

   TOUGH SKIN -- +1 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Hardy, Toughness 12+.
 
   IRON SKIN -- +1 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Tough Skin, Toughness 15+.
 
   STEEL SKIN -- +2 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Iron Skin, Toughness 20+.
 
   MITHRIL SKIN -- +3 to PV.
   Prerequisites: Steel Skin, Dwarf.

Rating: 7 (5 without Mithril Skin)

Debatable. With the current combat system, PV is not as useful as
DV in the mid-late game. If you want to be difficult to damage, 
you're better off using a shield and/or buying the DV talents. 
On the other hand, PV is much more important in the early game.
If you feel that your character is most vulnerable early on, you
might want to give these talents serious thought, even if you
can't get Mithril Skin.
It's a big chunk of your available talents, however; Steel Skin 
is 4 talents fr +3 HP and +4 PV, and Mithril Skin is 5 talents 
for +3 HP and +7 PV.

   IMMUNE TO PAIN -- One point of damage is always negated for all
      attacks. At least one point of damage will be caused 
      nonetheless.
   Prerequisites: Iron Skin, Willpower 15+.

Rating: 5

This is like a point of super-PV, that applies to everything, always.
Unfortunately, it's a single point, and it's a dead-end talent.
Probably not worth it.

   --- MAGICAL TALENTS ---

   POTENT AURA -- +3 power points.
   Prerequisites: Mana 10+

Rating: 3 
Prerequisite for: Strong Aura(4-8), Strong Magic(3-6), Charged(4-7?),
   Strong Healer(4-7), Good Book Learner(4)

This talent is the prerequisite for every single MAGICAL TALENT. By
itself, though, it's not very useful; 3 power points are even less 
impressive a bonus than 3 hit points (see Hardy).

   STRONG AURA -- +6 power points.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Mana 12+.

Rating: 4 
Prerequisite for: Mighty Aura(4-8), Durable Magic(3-4),
   Great Book Learner(4), Good Book Caster(5-8)

Again, not too impressive in itself, but the prerequisite for two
useful talents.

   MIGHTY AURA -- +9 power points.
   Prerequisites: Strong Aura, Mana 15+

Rating: 4 
Prerequisite for: Extended Magic(3-4), Great Book Caster(5-8)

Still not worth it by itself (the 18 mana given by this talent and 
its two prerequisites is a drop in the bucket for any serious
spellcaster), but it is the prerequisite for Great Book Caster
(an excellent talent), and Extended Magic (a not so excellent one)


   STRONG MAGIC -- +2 to all damage caused by spells.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Mana 15+.

Rating: 3 (6 for pure spellcasters)

Not a prerequisite, but can be a useful talent for spellcasters. 
Unfortunately, +2 is not much at all.

   CHARGED -- Regenerates power points at higher speed.
   Prerequisites: Mana 16+, Potent Aura.

Rating: 4? (7? for pure spellcasters)

The rating for this talents depends on exactly _how_ much extra
PP regeneration it gives. If it's the same 20% you get for Healty,
and it's added on _after_ Concentration bonuses, I'd give it a 
rating of 7 for pure spellcasters, 4 for everyone else. It's quite
good, but not quite good enough to be essential.
Note that in the latest version of ADOM (1.1.1), casting spells
from HP is not as good an idea as it use to be, since doing so
abuses the Mana attribute. This makes mana regeneration more 
useful than it used to be.

   DURABLE MAGIC -- all spell durations are increased by the PCs
      current level times 3.
   Prerequisites: Willpower 16+, Strong Aura.

Rating: 3 (4 for pure spellcasters)

Spells this applies to (presumably) are Bless, Slow Monster, 
Invisibility, Strength of Atlas, Farsight, and possibly Scare Monster.
That's not a lot, and most of these spells can simply be recast when
needed, making this a not-very-useful talent.

   EXTENDED MAGIC -- all spell ranges are increased by 2.
   Prerequisites: Mana 24+, Mighty Aura.

Rating: 3 (4 for pure spellcasters)

For bolt spells, a range increase of 2 also means a damage 
increase of 2, IIRC. For this reason and Death Ray, this could have
been a marginally useful talent. Unfortunately, for most spellcasters,
it's tough to get it in the early game, when bolt spells (and this 
talent) would be the most useful.
Note that this talent does _not_ increase the area of effect of ball
spells.

   STRONG HEALER -- +4 to all damage healed by spells.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Willpower 15+.

Rating: 4-6 (7 for pure spellcasters)

This can be a good talent, and not just for pure spellcasters. Its
usefulness wanes in the late game, but early on, it boosts healing
spells by quite a bit. Most characters don't have to heal themselves
very often, but when they do, it's sometimes imprerative that they
heal as fast as possible, which is why this talent is a potential
life-saver.

   GOOD BOOK LEARNER -- PC is 10% more effective when learning 
      spells from spell books.
   Prerequisites: Potent Aura, Good Learner.

   GREAT BOOK LEARNER -- PC is 10% more effective when learning 
      spells from spell books.
   Prerequisites: Good Book Learner, Strong Aura, Great Learner.

Rating: 4

These are just not very good. Together, they give 21%. If they gave
more than that, they could be useful for borderline-spellcasters, 
like paladins. 21% is just not a significant enough boost, though.

   GOOD BOOK CASTER -- Casting spells from books costs only double
      power points.
   Prerequisites: Careful, Strong Aura, Dexterity 14+.

   GREAT BOOK CASTER -- Casting spells from books costs only 50% more
      power points.
   Prerequisites: Good Book Caster, Mighty Aura, Dexterity 18+,
      Perception 15+.

Rating: 7-8 (5 for pure spellcasters)

These can be excellent talents, primarily _not_ for pure spellcasters
(who tend to get enough castings from books anyway, thank you very
much, and have enough mana to cast from books when they need to), but
for characters learning spells at low effectivity through various 
means, then casting the spells via books. Unfortunately, most of these
characters tend to wince at the 2-3 Aura talent prerequisites. Still,
these can definitely be worth considering.

   --- MISCELLANEOUS TALENTS ---
 
   GOOD LEARNER -- Learns very fast. +2% to all experience gained.
   Prerequisites: Learning 10+.
  
   GREAT LEARNER -- Learns extremely fast. +3% to all experience
      gained.
   Prerequisites: Learning 16+.
  
   Rating: 4 (5 for trolls)

Not quite good enough for serious consideration. +5% XP is never
enough for a single level, and spending two talents - 6 levels' 
worth! on this small amount of extra XP seems like a waste.
Charactes with very important class abilities, like Mindcrafters,
could find even this little bit of extra XP useful, but +5% is
just pitifully little.

   PORTER -- Carrying capacity is increased by 10% due to the PCs
      efficient packaging skills.
   Prerequisites: Strength 8+, Dexterity 10+.

   MASTER PACKAGER -- Carrying capacity is increased by 20% due to 
      the PCs efficient packaging skills.
   Prerequisites: Porter, Learning 12+, Perception 12+.

   BEAST OF BURDEN -- Carrying capacity is increased by 30% due to the
      PCs efficient packaging skills and great endurace. 
      Prerequisites: Master Packager, Willpower 12+, Toughness 12+.

Rating: 6 (8 for Monks)

These three talents together give a 71.6% bonus to carrying capacity.
This can be useful for most characters, and is especially critical 
for Monks, who can rarely afford even Burdened status.
If you want them, you should probably buy all three.

   LONG STRIDE -- Movement costs but 950 energy points.

Rating: 7

Faster movement is always good, and this is somewhat cumulative with
other bonuses. Also, unlike speed bonuses, it doesn't affect the XP
you get. Can be invaluable in the early game for outrunning cats (or
any other monster).

   QUICK -- +2 to Speed.

   VERY QUICK -- +3 to Speed.
   Prerequisites: Quick.

   GREASED LIGHTNING -- +4 to Speed.
   Prerequisites: Very Quick, Dexterity 15+.

Rating: 8

Speed is hard to come by, and a hefty +9 is probably worth the three
talents it costs. It does come with an XP hit, but not much.
Quick is also the prerequisite for Defensive Fighter and Quick Shot,
two great talents.

   HEALTHY -- Heals wounds 20% faster.

Rating: 6 (4 for spellcasters)

Anyone with easy access to healing spells will probably not need this
talent. If you're not a spellcaster, though, an extra 20% of natural 
healing can be handy in the early game, especially when you start
without the Healing skill. Later on, it's not that important, so buy
this talent early or not at all.

   SIXTH SENSE -- More easily evades traps.
   Prerequisites: Perception 18+.

Rating: ?

Unfortunately, does not say how _much_ more easily. This can 
potentially be very useful; traps can be a very nasty and unavoidable 
source of equipment destruction, and can even be a serious danger in
the early game.

   MECHANICALLY INCLINED -- All Disarm Traps checks are 10% easier.

Rating: 1

Absolutely useless. Disarm Traps is a low-priority skill in any case,
and 10% is nothing.

   MISER -- Tends to find more gold because he looks more intensely
      for it.

Rating: 4 
Prerequisite for: Treasure Hunter(9)

If you don't want to get Treasure Hunter, it's probably not a good 
idea to take Miser; gold is just not that difficult to come by in 
ADOM, and the easiest ways to get gold are unaffected by Miser.

   TREASURE HUNTER -- Finds more items.
   Prerequisites: Alert, Miser

Rating: 9

Considered by many to be the best talent overall. I estimate that a
character with the Treasure Hunter talent gets about 50% more items 
than one without. The quality of items is unaffected, but 50% is a 
whole lot. Well worth the two prerequisites, in my opinion.

   SILVER TONGUE -- Shop prices are reduced by 10%.
   Prerequisites: Charisma 10+.

   NATURAL TRADER -- Shop prices are reduced by 20%.
   Prerequisites: Silver Tongue, Charisma 14+.

Rating: 3

Again, money is not much of an issue in ADOM, and a 32% drop in 
prices is just not that impressive.

   PIOUS -- Prayers are 5% less expensive.
   Prerequisites: Willpower 15+.

   VERY PIOUS -- Prayers are 5% less expensive.
   Prerequisites: Pious, Willpower 20+.

   SAINT -- Prayers are 5% less expensive.
   Prerequisites: Strong of Will, Very Pious, Willpower 30+.

Rating: 2

These three are ridiculously weak. Prayers being 16% cheaper is a 
very slight effect, and would probably not be very worthwhile even
as a single talent. As the sum of three talents, it's pathetic.
With all three talents, 6 prayers will still cost a bit more piety
than 5 prayers would for a person without these talents. Not 
exactly exciting news.

   SCOUT -- More likely to evade wilderness encounters. Less likely to
      be ambushed.
   Prerequisites: Dexterity 10+, Perception 13+.

Rating: 5 (3 for spellcasters)

Can be somewhat useful in the very early game. Until and unless the
uber-jackal effect is fixed, this can retain its usefulness for non-
spellcasters. Still not a worthwhile pick, though; any character past
level 20 ought to have a solution to wilderness ambushes.

   STEALTHY - All Stealth checks are 10% easier.

Rating: 3

This might be interesting if it gave 30% or more. Even then, you'd 
have to play a "stealthy" character to make use of the bonus, which 
would be fun, but not really powerful. As is, the effect of this
talent is negligible.

0.14.17 The final score

The exact algorithm presented here may be out of date. At one point, 
the final score was calculated as follows:

score = sum of all skill scores / 20 +
        spell memory [the first number] for each known spell / 5 + 50 +
        MIN(piety - 200, 10000000) +
        (level - 1) * 50 +
        experience / 10 +
        (sum of the danger ratings [1-50] of explored levels) * 30 +
        MIN(value of all items on body / 50, 20000000) +
        (# identified items * 100) +
        various amounts for having intrinsics (between 200 and 10000 each) +
        ~2000 (retrieving the cute puppy) +
        20000 (making Blup happy) +
        (sum of attribute modifications * 200) +
        (# of successful dwarven quests * 5000) +
        5000 (if member of thieves guild) +
        5000 (if head of thieves guild) +
        1000 (adhering to the principles of the Cat Lord)
        250000 (saving Khelavaster) +
        2000000 (being a paragon of order) +
        MAX(0, 300 - max. hitpoints) * 1000 (only if the game was completed) +
        20000 (no divine interventions and game complete) +
        20000 (champion) +
        -10000 (fallen champion) +
        -(chaos score * 5) (typical about 1000 points score per corruption)


This score is doubled if you managed to solve the major goal of the game.

If you managed to solve the game _and_ leave the Drakalor Chain the following is added to 
that score:

        MAX(0, moves - 50000) * 100

Then the score is once more doubled.

1.                        EARLY GAME STRATEGIES


1.1 What kind of character is good for each starsign?


A) Raven

The +10 to speed is good for all PCs. It can save the life of low level PCs who need to 
run away from a monster they can't handle. The "messengers will reach you faster" refers 
to the delivery of the rune-covered trident, which happens faster for those born in this 
month, a nice bonus. The "harder to trick by deceptions" grants resistance to confusion 
attacks by dopplegangers. The stronger companions characteristic makes this month 
excellent for bards.

B) Book 

Lawful tendencies is a weak effect. One free skill increase each level helps all PCs, 
especially those with low learning. Increased chance to learn spells means borderline 
cases have a better chance. This is not the ideal month for a wizard - they are already 
great at learning spells. More suited to elven fighting classes or a dwarvish paladin. 

C) Wand 

Here we have the sign for a neutral wizard. Gray elven wizards are ideal with their 
naturally high mana and neutral alignment. They are somewhat difficult to keep alive in 
the early game but become enormously powerful in the mid- and endgame.

D) Unicorn 

Generic sign with resistance to corruption. Pretty attractive for any PC going for an 
ultra ending, especially an aspiring Avatar of Order. The fact that lawful alignment is 
difficult to change means such a PC can commit a few chaotic acts and get away with it 
without becoming a fallen champion. Also nice for an aspiring (ultimate) chaos god, 
since crowned chaotics are corrupted more rapidly than others.

E) Salamander 

Very attractive for elementalists, who rely on a lot of fire magic. Not half bad for a 
necromancer who finds some fire-based spellbooks, either. Necromancers need that +3 to 
Mana.

F) Dragon 

Fighters. The +1 to toughness is not significant - that is within the variability for 
the stat for identical race/class PCs. The -3 to willpower is significant and makes 
this unattractive for those who need it in the early game - wizards, mindcrafters. Not 
a bad month for paladins with both weapon and combat magic costs reduced.

G) Sword 

Learning bonus is insignificant, although it can push a PC from illiterate to literate. 
The 20% reduction in cost to train melee weapon skills makes this attractive for a PC 
that really wants to become super-proficient with a weapon. Not a bad choice for rangers 
who start the game dual wielding swords.

H) Falcon 

Grants the survival skill to any character. This skill is generally considered as being 
of little use (see section 0.4). The willpower bonus is somewhat useful for spellcasters 
and mindcrafters, although better starsigns exist for those classes. The charisma bonus 
is of little significance for any character, with the possible exception of bards, 
necromancers and male merchants. The free talent is good for all PCs, especially for 
gnomish and hurthling bards, as it guarantees them both a very useful heir gift and the 
possibility to go for the treasure hunter talent.

I) Cup 

Another sign for wizards. Higher learning to start and the 10% reduction to gain a level 
means they advance rapidly, which is very helpful in keeping them alive at low level. The 
20% effectivity increase in learning spells also helps keep them alive in the early game, 
while the player has not had time to raise their learning score.

J) Candle 

This can be an unbelievable sign for trolls. They heal rapidly anyway, but those born in 
this month almost don't need the Healing skill! Almost. Get it and they seem to have 
natural regeneration. Playing a trollish healer born in this month is almost cheating. ;-)

K) Wolf 

Significant benefits to perception and willpower. The willpower is good for wizards and 
mindcrafters, of course. Races that start with lower perception include dwarves, orcs and 
of course trolls.

L) Tree 

Made for mindcrafters, who really need that +5 to willpower in the early game. Not bad 
for wizards either.


1.2 Places to go to start


1.2.1 Terinyo


1.2.1.1 Tywat Pare

Tywat Pare is the sheriff in Terinyo. He is the source of two quests. The first is to 
find and kill Kranach, a raider lord terrorizing the countryside. The rewards for this 
quest are a lawful boost to alignment and 3000 gold pieces. Note that the lawful boost 
is greater if a magnanimous PC leaves the 3000 gold pieces on the ground where Tywat 
Pare drops them.

The second quest is available once the PC reaches experience level ten. The quest 
objective is to kill the crime lord Hotzenplotz, who can be found in the outlaw village 
Lawenilothehl near Terinyo. Note that attacking Hotzenplotz while he is nonhostile is a 
chaotic act. However, the lawful boost received when Tywat Pare is informed of the success 
of the mission more than offsets this. As a reward for this quest Tywat Pare will give the 
PC a blessed amulet of order, an extraordinarily useful item. If the PC has done *both* 
the Kranach quest and the Hotzenplotz quest, Tywat Pare will also teach the PC the Law 
skill after completing the Hotzenplotz quest.

An amulet of order is also available from Tywat Pare if a lawful PC lures him to a 
location where outlaw types can be found.  Lawenilothehl is good for this, but a 
random wilderness encounter with bandits or raiders will also work.  Tywat Pare says 
"Let's slay some evil bandits!" and the game generates the message "He hands you a 
deputy's badge."  The badge is in fact an amulet of order, which ordinarily seems to 
be uncursed.  Cursed or blessed amulets are possible.

Tywat Pare will also pay a bounty ranging from 50 - 150 gold pieces for the corpse of 
outlaw types, including outlaws, outlaw leaders and muggers.  Some unusual corpses 
fall outside this range: A master assassin corpse is worth 500 gold pieces.  At the 
other end of the scale, cutpuse corpses are only worth 5 gold pieces.


1.2.1.1.1 Kranach 

Kranach and his gang can be found in the wilderness around Terinyo. Finding him is a 
matter of chance and thus can require considerable game time (and therefore food). There 
is an experience point limit for this quest. In general, Kranach flees the Drakalor Chain 
if the PC reaches experience level six. The exception is trolls, who require more 
experience to advance in level. The exact limit is not known, but trolls should definitely 
be able to find Kranach at experience level four, possibly also at experience level five. 
Note the experience level six disqualification especially in the case of mindcrafters, who 
are very weak in melee in the early game. They do not gain a true offensive mindcraft 
ability until they reach experience level six. Therefore it is very desirable to engage 
Kranach and his gang with a mindcrafter that is just about to achieve experience level 
six. Ideally, the first or second kill after finding Kranach should raise the mindcrafter 
PC to experience level six.

If Kranach leaves a corpse be sure to collect it and attempt to get it back to Tywat 
Pare in Terinyo. When given the corpse, he pays a bounty of 300 gold pieces and 
remarks "We'll put up his head in some public location." Later, on entering Munxip's 
food store, the PC receives the message "A mummified skull hangs over the door of this 
shop."


1.2.1.2 Rynt

Rynt is the village elder in Terinyo. He provides a quest, which is mutually exclusive 
with Guth'Alak's quest. The quest is to find the village carpenter Yrrigs who has 
disappeared in a nearby dungeon (which does not appear unless the quest has been 
assigned). The reward for this quest is lower prices in Munxip's food store and some 
directions on how to proceed with the game. Depending on exactly how the quest is 
completed, there are additional rewards available - see the next section.


1.2.1.2.1 The Village Dungeon, Jharod and Yrrigs

The Village Dungeon is where Yrrigs can be found, after receiving the quest from Rynt.  
It is southeast of Terinyo.  It consists of seven levels.  Two important NPCs are found in 
the Village Dungeon.  The first is Jharod, the healer, found on VD:4.  He will heal PCs of 
any alignment up to seven times.  This can be vital for those PCs without the Healing 
skill.  He will also cure sickness and poisoning.  Jharod will teach non-chaotic PCs the 
Healing skill, or provide a blessed stethoscope or potion of ultra healing and increase 
the knowledge of the skill for those PCs that already have it, providing the PC is able to 
prove his ability to show "mercy."

This can be done in two ways.  The first is healing wounded monsters with the Heal 
spell or potions of healing.  The second involves Yrrigs the carpenter, who has become 
insane due to his lengthy stay in the dungeon.  Yrrigs can be found on the last level 
of the dungeon, level seven.  He will be a purple 't' and will be hostile.  He is 
moderately dangerous. Despite his purple color, Yrrigs does not have a corrupting melee 
attack, nor does using Mindcraft against him corrupt a Mindcrafter.   Ideally he should 
be led to Jharod, who will heal him.  Yrrigs recovers from his illness and leaves a Manual 
of Bridge Building, a hatchet and a cursed oil of rust removal as rewards.  While leading 
Yrrigs to Jharod, the PC should use tactics that are as defensive as possible.  This means 
using the 'Coward' setting and possibly dual-wielding shields.  Problems arise when the 
PC encounters other monsters that must be fought on the way back to Jharod, of course.  
It is possible to complete Rynt's quest by killing Yrrigs.  In this case Yrrigs drops his 
items immediately, but the PC must demonstrate mercy in another way in order to receive 
the Healing skill from Jharod, and Rynt does not lower the prices in Munxip's shop.  
After saving Yrrigs, he can be found in Terinyo and can further train the Bridge Building 
skill.

The PC will receive lawful boosts during this quest, once for luring Yrrigs to Jharod 
and once for reporting back to Rynt.


1.2.1.3 Munxip

Munxip is the shopkeeper in Terinyo. His is a specialty shop, selling food only. Like all 
shopkeepers, he is *tough*. It is best for low level PCs to buy from his shop without 
attempting anything dishonest.


1.2.1.4 The tiny girl

The tiny girl is the source of a quest. The objective is to rescue her puppy from a 
dungeon northeast of Terinyo. The reward for the quest is a lawful boost. Note that this 
quest is difficult and entirely optional. See the next section for more details.


1.2.1.4.1 The Puppy Cave

The puppy dungeon is six levels deep; the puppy is on the last level. The last level must 
be entered before four days of game time have elapsed, otherwise the puppy is generated as 
a corpse, presumably dying from starvation. There are some guaranteed features in the 
dungeon. The first is a hive of giant ants, always found on the second level. These are 
very difficult to kill for a low level PC and ideally should be avoided completely. The 
second is an open cavernous level on the fifth level with a high monster generation rate 
that is characteristic of these open levels. Finally, there is a lesser vault on the last 
level of the dungeon. The puppy generally can be found without fighting through the vault; 
this is the best course of action. The puppy will be tame if found alive and will follow 
the PC out of the dungeon. Take care, however, since the puppy will fight the PC's enemies 
on the way out, even enemies that are too difficult for it to kill. The general approach 
on this quest should be to get to the bottom of the dungeon, carefully find the puppy and 
get out as fast as possible with a minimum of fighting. Note also that if the puppy is 
generated dead, retrieving the corpse and returning it to the tiny girl still provides 
some lawful boost. Furthermore this means that the quest can be done *at any time* after 
the PC has gained experience thus having a better chance of surviving the dungeon. It is 
worthwhile to do this quest even if the time limit has passed, since shops, altars, herbs 
and pools can be generated in this dungeon. Hives containing bees are common but not 
guaranteed.


1.2.1.5 Yggaz

Yggaz is the village fool in Terinyo. He is a source of rumors and will trade random 
potions for potions of booze.


1.2.1.6 Guth'Alak

Guth'Alak is a druid found in Terinyo. He provides two quests. The first is to find and 
kill an evil chaotic druid, Keethrax, who is found in a dungeon southeast of Terinyo. Note 
that this quest and Rynt's are mutually exclusive. There are two sets of rewards for this 
quest, chosen by the PC. The PC may choose between "knowledge" and "power." Choosing power 
results in gifts of a wand of cold and a spellbook of Frost Bolt. Choosing knowledge 
results in Guth'Alak teaching the PC the Herbalism skill(or Gardening, if Herbalism is 
already at 100). Guth'Alak provides additional rewards to druids who complete this quest.

Guth'Alak's second quest is available only after the PC reaches experience level 30. The 
quest is to find and help the Greater White Unicorn, Yrruir. This is the only way to 
access the unicorn quests, whether the PC chooses to attempt Yrruir's quest or Riurry's 
quest. See 0.10.2.4 and 0.10.3.8.


1.2.1.6.1 The Druid Dungeon and Keethrax

The corrupted evil druid Keethrax is found in the Druid Dungeon southeast of Terinyo. He 
is found on the bottom level of this seven level dungeon. As a druid, he maintains a 
contingent of hostile animals on the final level. These will include felines (see section 
0.9.2) and giant slugs (nasty acid breathers, but their corpses are a source of acid 
immunity). He is vulnerable to acid, webs and magic missiles, but little else in the way of 
magic. He uses missile weapons and casts spells including Darkness that make him a 
formidable enemy for PCs less than experience level ten. Some players regard him as an 
out-of-depth opponent and defer this quest until later in the game. He carries an 
artifact, the Black Torc, which is a decent missile weapon but permanently cursed. It is 
good fodder for the demented ratling (see section 2.4.8). Keethrax always leaves a corpse. 
Picking up his corpse is a chaotic act, but Guth'Alak will reward non-chaotic PCs with a 
potion of cure corruption in exchange for returning Keethrax's corpse to him.


1.2.1.7 Blup

Blup is a baby water dragon. He asks the PC to find his mother. He will also teach the 
swimming skill if given potions of carrot juice. Blessed potions are more effective as 
one would expect. His mother can be found in an underwater cave in the large lake west of 
Terinyo. This is not something low level PCs should attempt. It requires the ability to 
breathe water, or *very* careful planning. There are also very dangerous monsters found 
in the underwater cave. More information on this is found in section 2.13.


1.2.1.8 Townspeople

The remaining townspeople are simply flavor elements without any real importance in the 
game. Note however, that farmers are found in Terinyo. A farmer corpse is a quest object 
for Gaab'Baay (see section 2.21.6). Farmers will also trade rations for tools, such as a 
scythe.


1.2.2 Lawenilothehl

Lawenilothehl is an outlaw village found to the southwest of Terinyo. The name is an 
anagram of "hole in the wall", American slang for a shabby place. It contains a variety 
of shady characters who can be useful.


1.2.2.1 Yergius

Yergius is the head of the Thieves' Guild. He can teach or train a variety of useful skills for non-lawful PCs. They are Climbing, Detect Traps, Disarm traps, Pick locks, 
Pick Pockets and Stealth. Yergius teaches Pick Pockets to any non-lawful PC at no cost. Bear in mind that obtaining even the Pick Pockets skill from Yergius is a chaotic act. 
He will only teach or train the remainder of these skills once the PC has demonstrated 
his talents as a thief. In practice, this means that the PC must successfully use the 
Pick Pockets skill 28 times (according to the recent best estimates) against monsters vulnerable to this skill. This includes most humanoids, constructs and undead. Animals in general do not have pockets to pick, although ratlings (not rats or giant rats, but archers, duelists, fencers, etc.) are vulnerable. A successful application of the skill will result in a stolen item being added to the PC's inventory, or the message "The -foo- does not seem to own anything valuable." Note that Yergius' initial training results in a Pick Pockets skill level of one. This means that it is not really useful until it is trained and an experience level or two has been gained, thus making it eligible for advancement. Using the Pick Pockets skill is a relatively minor chaotic act, and furthermore seems to have a limited alignment effect. PCs never seem to become C- by 
using Pick Pockets.

It is also apparently possible to satisfy Yergius by robbing shops, but the quantitation 
is not understood. Robbing shops is a very risky activity for PC's less than experience 
level 20 anyway.

The main initial reason for attempting this quest is to satisfy Yergius and receive the 
Detect Traps skill from him. This makes the underground level of the Dwarven Graveyard 
and the Pyramid in general much easier and safer, not to mention the elemental temples.

After satisfying Yergius he will teach new skills for prices ranging from 3000 - 4000 
gold pieces. Detect Traps in particular is well worth the 3500 gold pieces it costs. 
He will also offer training of two different types: theoretical and practical. Theoretical 
training will raise the PC's dice modifier available when experience level advancement 
occurs. The maximum is +4d5. This is simply a matter of cash. If the PC has plenty of 
money available and wants to maximize a skill that Yergius trains quickly, pay him 
whatever is required to get the modifier to +4d5. The second form of training he offers is 
practical. When the PC trains in this way, it adds successful skill checks to the skill, 
making it easier to advance. This also is a matter of cash. It is a very good idea to use 
this practical training if the PC is about to face an area where a newly learned skill 
will be needed. Again, the underground level of the Dwarven Graveyard and the Pyramid are 
obvious examples of areas where the Detect Traps skill will be needed, while the PC has 
probably had little time to train the skill.

Another example where Yergius' theoretical and practical training can be very useful is 
the Climbing skill. Climbing = 100 is required for entering the Rift, which is something 
all spellcasters should seriously consider for access to the Sinister Library of Niltrias. 
Trolls should also visit the Library for much-needed experience. It is possible to train 
Climbing without Yergius' assistance, for example by mountaineering, but this takes place 
in the wilderness, thus wasting large amounts of valuable time.

Non-lawful PCs who kill Yergius become the new head of the Thieves' Guild and as such 
receive 50% off the prices at Barnabas' black market (see next section). Of course killing 
him means that he is no longer available for training, so take advantage of his training 
before killing him.

Yergius also sells thieves' picks to non-lawful PCs with the Pick Locks 
skill who have no Thieves' Picks.


1.2.2.2 Barnabas

Barnabas maintains a general store type of shop in Lawenilothehl. As might be expected 
from the general atmosphere in the town, it is a black market. As such, the prices 
demanded are very high. Nevertheless, it is worth visiting. Simply observing what is for 
sale identifies items. Barnabas also usually has rocks for sale at relatively reasonable 
prices, which can be tremendously useful for hurthlings. Barnabas occasionally has high 
quality items for sale, which can be within the monetary reach of PCs who have done the 
Kranach quest. In addition to the 50% reduction in prices for being head of the Thieves' 
Guild (see above section 1.2.2.1), Barnabas also changes his offers when the PC sells 
items: 1/4 of base value for nonmembers, 1/3 of base value for members and 1/2 of base 
value if the PC is the head of the Thieves' Guild, regardless of whether he was a former 
member or alignment.


1.2.2.3 Kranf Niest

Kranf Niest is a nefarious doctor in Lawenilothehl. He can teach PCs the Healing skill 
after completing Hotzenplotz's Jharod quest. Kranf Niest does not have the gentle touch of 
Jharod. When a chaotic PC learns the Healing skill from him, the PC is teleported away in 
a stunned and confused state, loses 1d3 points in each of the Appearance, Learning and 
Willpower categories and is corrupted slightly (1%). During this process, Kranf Niest 
removes any helmet the PC might be wearing, even if it is cursed.  If the PC already has 
Healing, Kranf Niest gives the PC a scalpel and stethoscope.  It is a chaotic act to attack 
Kranf Niest, but the PC receives a small net lawful boost for killing him.


1.2.2.4 Skriek

Skriek is a ratling found in Lawenilothehl. He sells keys. The prices seem exorbitant, but 
they can save a PC's life.


1.2.2.5 Hotzenplotz and his guards

Hotzenplotz is a crime lord found in Lawenilothehl. He assigns two quests. The first is to 
kill Jharod, the healer. Jharod, and thus this quest, is only available if the PC has 
chosen Rynt's Yrrigs quest rather than Guth'Alak's Keethrax quest. Hotzenplotz arranges 
for Kranf Niest to teach the Healing skill as a reward. The second is to kill Tywat Pare. 
The reward is an amulet of Chaos. If the PC is on a mission from Tywat Pare to kill 
Hotzenplotz, a couple of points are worth remembering. Hotzenplotz is fairly tough and 
uses poison. He will kill a PC without poison resistance in melee quite easily. Second, he 
does not heal. A PC can attack him, run away into the wilderness and repeat this process 
until he is dead. The combination of these two characteristics should make it clear that 
the best way to attack him is with missiles or ranged spells.


1.2.2.6 Other inhabitants of Lawenilothehl

The other inhabitants are simply flavor elements with no real role in the game. They 
include muggers, beggars, cutpurses, bandits, outlaws and outlaw leaders. Beggars are 
useful because they will drop a potion of booze if the PC gives them ~50 gold pieces and 
then 'C'hats with them. It is usually cursed. Remember Yggaz, the fool in Terinyo, will 
trade random potions for potions of booze.


1.2.3 The Small Cave


1.2.3.1 Objectives, strategy for survival and items found in the Small Cave

The Small Cave is a popular place to start the game. It contains one very useful 
guaranteed item and often contains other non-guaranteed desirable items. The guaranteed 
items in the Small Cave are a scroll of information, a scroll of warning and a waterproof 
blanket. The scroll of information simply tells how many paces away the waterproof blanket 
is. The scroll of warning gives some advice about tactics for the small cave. It reads 
"Time is working against you!" This is true. When the PC enters the small cave, monsters 
are generated on the level as is true of any dungeon level. As the original monsters are 
killed off, new monsters are generated. The new monsters are generated differently than on 
any other level in the game. They have approximately double the experience level of the 
PC. As might be imagined, this quickly gets very difficult to cope with and is the basis 
for the eternium man challenge game (see Appendix N, section N.1.2). This offers a way to 
quickly gain experience levels, but as a rule, PCs should get out of the Small Cave by 
experience level 5 at most.

The Small Cave also contains a down staircase which leads to the Unremarkable Dungeon. The 
Unremarkable Dungeon is normal in terms of danger and monster generation. It is also 
essential to enter the Unremarkable Dungeon at some point if the PC plans to try a special 
ending.

Out of depth weapons are sometimes found in the Small Cave. Eternium two-handed swords and 
halberds of defense are examples. Artifacts can be generated in the Small Cave, but this 
is rare. Altars can also be generated in the Small Cave.

Less interesting items are virtually guaranteed as well. The Small Cave always seems to 
contain some type of cloak, one or more quarterstaves and a shield of some type. These 
items are typically of low quality but useful nonetheless.

The general strategy for the Small Cave is to get in, find the waterproof blanket as 
quickly as possible, optionally find the down staircase and get out. Getting out can be 
via descent through the Unremarkable Dungeon or ascent back to the wilderness.

Note that the monsters generated in the Small Cave are in general common types: goblins, 
kobolds, bats, rats and the like. Making a first kill in the Small Cave is not a good idea 
if a special ending is planned (see section 0.9.1).


1.2.3.2 Should PCs descend through the Unremarkable Dungeon?

After retrieving the waterproof blanket and locating the down stairs in the Small Cave 
(easier said than done), PCs may choose to descend through the Unremarkable Dungeon. As 
mentioned, it is essential to go through this dungeon in order to complete a special 
ending. If the PC chooses to do this, the Kranach quest will be lost, since the PC will be 
greater than experience level six by the time the Unremarkable Dungeon is traversed. The 
chance to complete the puppy quest successfully will also be lost, since the four day time 
limit will expire by the time the PC manages to get back to Terinyo. Despite the fact that 
monsters are generated in the Small Cave at twice the PC's experience level, it is 
possible to leave the Small Cave and reenter it later in order to gain access to the 
Unremarkable Dungeon. It can be done using invisibility. The monsters generated are high 
level relative to the PC, but they are not in general "special" monsters that have the 
ability to see invisible. Thus a high level PC can use invisibility to make a quick dash 
through the Small Cave and descend to the Unremarkable Dungeon.

Items that grant invisibility are by no means guaranteed so this strategy is not available 
to every PC. Many players will descend through the Unremarkable Dungeon every time if 
possible.


1.2.3.2.1 The nature of the Unremarkable Dungeon

The Unremarkable Dungeon is (probably deliberately by TB) misnamed. It is quite 
remarkable. It generally contains more special features - altars, pools, forges, herbs, 
shops and the like, than any other dungeon in the game. These are all nice features. The 
Unremarkable Dungeon also seems to contain more door traps than any other dungeon, which 
is not so nice. In any case, the bottom of the Unremarkable Dungeon, level 7 or 8, contains 
two up staircases. One of the staircases leads to the High Mountain Village.


1.2.3.2.2 The High Mountain Village - introduction

The High Mountain Village is an interesting wilderness location. It contains a shop and 
various NPCs who are mostly useful to chaotics and essential for those PCs attempting a 
special ending. One significant problem is the possibility of meeting a Stone Giant Lord 
upon entering the High Mountain Village. This monster is very difficult to defeat for a 
relatively low level PC that has descended directly from the Small Cave through the 
Unremarkable Dungeon to the High Mountain Village. The Stone Giant Lord is not generated 
every time, but the possibility is an argument against entering the Unremarkable Dungeon 
directly from the Small Cave with a low level PC. The High Mountain Village contains a 
hidden exit to the northern central part of the wilderness map. It is found from the 
inside of the western village wall. This means that the PC need not go all the way back 
through the Unremarkable Dungeon and the Small Cave in order to exit.

More on the High Mountain Village is found in section 2.21.


1.2.4 The Infinite Dungeon - beginning

More about the Infinite Dungeon (ID) can be found in section 2.25. Here we are concerned 
only with the start of the game.


1.2.4.1 Why start the game in the Infinite Dungeon?

Starting the game in the ID is a very conservative approach for PCs that are weak at the 
start of the game. Given the significance of the first kill, it is probably not advisable 
to make the first kill in the ID, but gaining further experience while staying on level 
one of the ID is about as safe as things get in ADOM. The PC can flee from anything 
threatening, such as dark rooms or tension rooms, by exiting the ID and reentering. This 
strategy is one way to get difficult classes to experience level five or so before the ID 
becomes intolerably tedious.


1.2.5 The Wilderness

The wilderness is the overland map of the Drakalor Chain. It is often regarded as a curse 
by new players, whose PC's are killed in wilderness encounters and have difficulty keeping 
their PCs fed during treks across the wilderness. Advanced players with PCs who are well 
equipped to deal with the wilderness regard it as a wonderful resource.

The Survival skill can be useful for lengthy stays in the wilderness, but note that 
applying it wastes a lot of game time.


1.2.5.1 Why start the game in the Wilderness?

Many players will start the game in the wilderness, at least for the first kill, because 
the first monster killed can be controlled according to what type of wilderness square 
generates an encounter.


1.2.5.2 Strategy and problems in the wilderness

In order to avoid wasting too much time in the wilderness (e.g. because of the dreadful 90 
day limit), it is good to know how long it actually takes to do things in the wilderness.

All times are approximate since there are slight variations of some minutes. It is also 
the case that without apparent reason walking times are sometimes doubled. This can happen 
for any terrain type and might be a bug. Recent reports (September 25th, 2000) indicate 
that traveling through the wilderness while burdened or strained does not cause this 
phenomenon. Being burdened or strained has a marginal, if any, effect on movement time in 
the wilderness.


Time Spent    Action

nothing       changing body armor
60 min        changing other parts of equipment
60 min        resting
60 min        moving onto a plains, road, water, or special
              (dungeon entrance and the like) square
90 min        moving onto a hills square
120 min       moving onto a forest square
180 min       moving onto a swamp square
300 min       moving onto a mountain square (provided you own a climbing set)
240 min       applying Survival (Rangers of level 1-5 and non-Rangers)
120 min       applying Survival (Rangers of level 6-50)

Note that the swimming skill and water breathing intrinsic have no effect on the time 
needed to move onto a water square. Likewise, the climbing skill and the 
blessed/uncursed/cursed staus of a climbing set have no effect on the time needed to move 
onto a mountain square.

Note that a climbing set is required to move onto mountains. It is important to know the 
status of a climbing set, in particular making sure it is not cursed. A cursed climbing 
set will fail at the most inopportune moment. At a minimum, the resulting slip while 
mountaineering will cause extensive equipment destruction. It is often fatal. The blessed 
vs uncursed status seems to have little or no effect.


1.2.5.3 The Survival skill

Successfully applying the Survival skill when not bloated increases the 
satiation value of the PC by about 100 (equivalent to 1/5 large ration, see 
Appendix G). This is roughly tripled for Rangers of level 6 or above. These 
values hold for both water and land squares.

If the PC is already bloated, his satiation value isn't increased. Instead, 
he gathers plant seeds (on land squares) or goes fishing (on water squares). 
The amount of seeds gathered does not depend on terrain type or skill value 
and averages at about 5.2. For Rangers of level 6 or above, the average 
number of seeds gathered is about 16.7.

When fishing is successful, the PC obtains exactly one piece of fish meat.

The chances of success when applying the Survival skill depend on skill value, 
terrain type and the Ranger level 6 class power. The following success rates 
were measured by applying the Survival skill 100 times, with a skill value of 
100. The "normal" column applies to non-Rangers and Rangers of level 1-5, the 
"high" column to Rangers of level 6-50.

                              normal   high
Special (dungeon, village)    100%     100%
Forest                        100%     100%

Road                           93%     100%

Water                          43%      72%


1.3 Places to avoid in the early game

There are a few locations on the wilderness map that are to be avoided for low level PCs. 
One of the more mundane is the road found in the central part of the wilderness. 
Unfortunately, the easy traveling afforded by this road attracts monsters who will try to 
kill new adventurers. It is quite likely that a hostile group of chaos brothers and 
sisters will be found on this road, as well as wandering bands of bandits and other outlaw 
types, including assassins, who use poison. Bottom line: avoid the road with a low level 
PC. Travel through the plains and forest areas instead.

As far as truly deadly areas go, the entrance to Darkforge is one. It is found in the 
central part of the map near the southern border. Darkforge itself is the second level of 
this particular dungeon. The danger level of the top level is not that high, but the down 
staircase is guarded by a steel golem. These are very tough monsters for a low level PC to 
defeat. A low level wizard who has trained the Lightning Bolt spell may have a chance but 
is asking for trouble. Another wilderness location that will kill low level PCs very 
quickly is the Tower of Eternal flames. Without good fire resistance and other special 
equipment, both the PC and his inventory will be incinerated. See section 2.19 for more on 
the Tower of Eternal Flames. Shyssiryxius' cave is difficult for low level PCs due to the 
need for water breathing or high hitpoints and on-demand teleportation, as well as the 
presence of nasty aquatic beasts such as dragon turtles. Some locations, such as the Rift 
and the Minotaur Maze, do not allow low level PCs to enter.


1.4 What's next?

After exploring the area around Terinyo, the next step is to undertake a trek through the 
wilderness to the main dungeon in the game, the Caverns of Chaos (CoC). If the PC chose 
Rynt's quest, Rynt will provide some advice about finding the CoC. Remember to take enough 
food to survive the trip through the wilderness! If the PC chose to descend through the 
Unremarkable Dungeon, he is already quite close to the entrance of the CoC, which is found 
in the western central part of the wilderness map.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.                        MID-GAME STRATEGIES


2.1 The early levels of the Caverns of Chaos (CoC)

The early levels of the CoC should not be a problem for PCs that manage to make it this 
far. They are comparable in difficulty to the Village Dungeon or the Unremarkable Dungeon. 
It is never wise to become overconfident, however. Even these levels may contain lesser 
vaults, tension rooms and named artifact guardians. There may be a split in the early 
dungeon levels of the CoC. Two down staircases may be available. This is by no means 
guaranteed.

When two down staircases are found on D: n (n=1, 2 or 3), the level D: n+1 has a roughly 
50% chance of containing a lesser vault. The level S: n+1 will never contain a vault. 
This suggests the S level may stand for 'S'afe or 'S'hortcut.

The main objective in the early part of the CoC is to find the Arena. More about the 
Arena level is found in section 2.2.


2.2 The Arena

The Arena level is found around D: 4. As might be expected at a huge attraction like the 
Arena, there are vendors selling items on this level.  The other guaranteed monster 
on the level is the Arena Master, who provides access to the Arena.  Note that he will 
not admit invisible PCs to the Arena, whether or not they have fought in the Arena 
before. He responds with "Sorry, we've hired more than enough invisible stalkers. Look 
for a job elsewhere or come back when some of yer pals are used up."

The Arena itself is for combat practice, with the rewards for a successful fight being 
gold pieces. The rewards get larger as the PC wins more fights. A PC should not fight 
more than nineteen times in the Arena before descending to deeper levels of the CoC. This 
is because he will encounter an NPC later who assigns a quest to win the 20th Arena fight. 
The 20th fight will be against a named former champion. These opponents are more difficult 
than the standard Arena opponents. There are four possibilities:

Li-Hon-Kay: ogre magus, uses invisibility and Frost Bolt, alternate name Li-Han-Kay
Spardakius: minotaur, brute force
Ripclaw: troll, brute force
Bonk: hill giant, brute force

Li-Hon-Kay can be particularly annoying and dangerous. PCs without cold resistance and the 
ability to see invisible will probably not survive a fight with Li-Hon-Kay. Fortunately, 
cold immunity and the ability to see invisible are granted by the Ancient Mummy Wrapping, 
an artifact armor held by Rehetep, the Mummy Lord (see section 2.9). Players who want to 
be conservative and maximize the chances of survival in the 20th Arena fight will tackle 
the Pyramid first. Note also that although ogre magi are somewhat resistant to confusion, 
if one is successfully confused using Mindcraft, they are unable to become invisible. This 
works for Li-Hon-Kay as well as ordinary ogre magi. The other 20th fight Arena opponents 
will fall to offensive magic or simple brute force bashing.

There are a limited number of fights available after the 20th fight, but beware: anything 
can be generated as an opponent in such fights. It is quite possible to be faced with an 
emperor lich or ancient karmic dragon. The monetary rewards for such fights are about 1000 
gold pieces each, not worth it if the PC has to face a difficult opponent.

Timofei Shatrov has determined the possible opponents the PC will face in the Arena.  There 
are five possible opponents in each fight, although some of them are duplicates.  The table 
below shows the possible opponents, with cats in capitals and duplicates in parentheses:

POSSIBLE ARENA MONSTERS:

 1 - giant rat      kobold           rat            goblin        (giant rat)
 2 - giant rat      kobold           orc            goblin        (giant rat)
 3 - gnoll	    hobgoblin	     orc            rabid dog     (hobgoblin)
 4 - gnoll          orc scorcher     hobgoblin      skeleton      zombie		
 5 - gnoll          orc scorcher     lizard man     fire beetle   giant bat
 6 - ghul           black hurthling  WILD CAT       wolf          giant bat
 7 - ghul           black hurthling  hyena          large kobold  jackal
 8 - ghul           orc scorcher     large gnoll    large kobold  bugbear
 9 - ogre           large orc        large gnoll    shadow        wererat
10 - ogre           large orc        kobold chief   shadow        werewolf
11 - large spider   cave fisher      orc chieftain  ankheg        gnoll chief 
12 - kobold shaman  dwarf            orc chieftain  ankheg        giant spider
13 - kobold shaman  dwarf            orc chieftain  ankheg        giant spider
14 - imp            displacer beast  orc chieftain  quasit        CAVE LION
15 - cave bear      displacer beast  minotaur       hippogriff    jackalwere
16 - cave bear      displacer beast  minotaur       hippogriff    jackalwere
17 - cave bear      dire wolf        minotaur       harpy         giant lizard
18 - cave bear      dark sage        tarantula      fire lizard   hell hound 
19 - cave bear      dark sage        tarantula      fire lizard   dark elven warrior


2.2.1 Ratling traders

There are several ratling traders on the Arena level who sell food. The best food source 
is cooked lizards, which weigh only 3 stones each and are very nutritious. Also available 
are fried bats, which are less nutritious but still acceptable. It is not worth buying rat 
tails or cooked roaches. They have a negative nutrition value, even for trolls, who can 
eat almost anything.

In contrast to shops, which restock dependent on total game time passed, the ratling 
traders seem to restock dependent on game passed on the Arena level only. Thus a PC may go 
off adventuring for many days, return to the Arena and find no new food available. Wait or 
run around on the level for a while and the traders should eventually restock.

It is worthwhile to 'n'ame the ratling traders according to the wares they sell. This 
prevents aimless searching for the traders who sell worthwhile food. They can also be 
slowed down with the Slow Monster spell, which will not turn them hostile.


2.2.2 Cats in the Arena

Cats in the Arena are a special problem.  If the PC wants the Ring of the Master Cat, 
directly killing cats must be avoided (see section 0.9.2).  There are several ways to deal 
with cats in the Arena.  Teleportation is one, from a wand or spell.  Potions of exchange 
thrown at a cat will turn it into another monster.  A cat can be led over a trap until it 
is killed, teleported or turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos.  However, if the PC 
creates or sets off a trap which kills a cat, he is charged with killing the cat. Thus 
teleportation and corruption traps are really the only useful traps worth creating as far 
as cats are concerned. Indeed, the PC should be careful about creating *any* traps in the 
Arena, since a subsequently generated cat could be killed by the trap (even after the 20th 
fight). For this reason, as well as general tactical information, it is useful to know the 
layout of traps in the Arena when they are created.  A map showing the traps produced when 
the Arena is generated on D: 3 is shown below:

  ###############.###############
  #0123456789AB0###456789AB01234#
  #123456789AB0123456789AB012345#
  #23456789AB0123456789AB0123456#
  #3456789AB0123456789AB01234567#
  ###############################

    0 - fireball      6 - arrow
    1 - pit           7 - acid
    2 - light         8 - pit (vipers)
    3 - corruption    9 - spear
    4 - stone block   A - teleport
    5 - alarm         B - water

The pattern shifts, but otherwise remains the same, and can therefore be worked out by 
creating a single trap, when the Arena is generated on other levels.


2.3 The Big Room

The Big Room is found on level six or seven of the CoC.  It is indeed one big room with 
no walls.  This means it is not possible to use corridors to restrict monster movement.  
If there are many monsters present they can always swarm the PC.  Breeders and summoners 
are thus very dangerous on this level.  If the PC does not have poison resistance this 
level is exceptionally dangerous since dark elven wizards and dark elven priestesses who 
summon poisonous spiders are guaranteed to appear sooner or later.  Breeders can get 
completely out of control on this level.  Even if they can't really hurt the PC, once a 
high enough number breed and *continue* to breed the PC can't kill them as fast as they 
are being generated.  Being trapped like this will lead to starvation eventually.  
Remember that breeders can be sterilized by a scroll of vermin control or divine 
intervention.

Herbs are guaranteed in the Big Room which leads to the dilemma of whether to stay and 
harvest herbs or flee from the constant onslaught of monsters.

Petri Sihvola has discovered a way around this dilemma. 
His post from RGRA:

2.4 The Si

The si (abbreviation for strange item, pronounced "see") is the first guaranteed 
artifact that most PCs will encounter, unless they have done the Keethrax quest.  
It is usually found on level 8 of the CoC.  The level message "The air of this 
level is filled with a strange smell." is always generated when entering the level 
containing the si.  It falls into the tool category and is thus represented by a ] 
character.  It always lies on a trap, so kick it off of the trap before picking it 
up if possible.

The si is an artifact that replicates.  Since they are artifacts, they are: 

1) indestructible - wield them as a melee weapon to prevent corrosion/damage from 
                    jellies if nothing better is available
2) valuable - sell them to shopkeepers: potentially limitless cash
3) sacrificial fodder - sacrifice them to the gods, although it may be more 
                        beneficial to sell them and sacrifice the gold

All of these properties together make sis rather nice items.  Always keep at least 
one.

Note that sis do not count as an artifact as far as the demented ratling is 
concerned.  Also never forget that they replicate.  They can get heavy after a 
while.  A particularly nasty effect results if sis are brought into the ID.  
On a long trip through the ID, sis will replicate to the point where they become 
annoyingly heavy.  This would not be a problem if the PC could simply drop most of 
them.  Unfortunately, they jump back into the PC's backpack before he leaves a 
level, no matter where on the level they were dropped.  Bottom line: *never* bring 
sis into the ID.


2.5 Dwarftown

Dwarftown is an important milestone in the game. It is a source of numerous helpful NPCs 
and locations, including a shop, a smithy, a coaligned altar (for non-chaotics) and a 
training hall where stats may be increased. Of equal importance is the fact that it is a 
resting place. After the descent through the upper CoC, the PC can rest here without 
constantly being assaulted by monsters. There is nothing hostile in Dwarftown initially, 
with the exception of an almost-guaranteed mimic in Waldenbrook's shop (note the empty 
space in the shop in the map below - it is a mimic).

      #######################################################################


2.5.1 Waldenbrook

Waldenbrook is the shopkeeper in Dwarftown.  His is a general store type of shop selling 
and buying a variety of goods.  He occasionally stocks an item or two of high quality, 
sometimes even an artifact.  His prices are generally reasonable.  Bear in mind, however, 
that he has the same racial prejudices as all other shopkeepers (see section 0.13.7).


2.5.2 Ruun

Ruun, the Priest in Dwarftown is always generated with the same race as the PC.  He 
presides over a small room containing an altar, which will be coaligned unless the PC is 
chaotic.  If a coaligned PC is carrying unidentified potions, it is worth 'C'hatting with 
him.  He will identify potions that have a healing effect: potions of (extra/ultra) 
healing and potions of cure poison.  If a PC whose alignment does not match the altar's 
'C'hats with him he responds with "Ye oughta convert.  Then we'll talk."

Note that converting the altar in Dwarftown (perhaps even attempting to convert it) will 
cause Ruun to become hostile, which in turn causes the entire town to become hostile.  
Luring him out of Dwarftown, killing him and then returning will not work either, as his 
shade returns to inform the dwarves of what has happened, resulting in the same scenario.  
Unless your PC knows exactly what he is doing and why he is doing it, angering or attacking 
Ruun is highly inadvisable.  See also section 2.5.8 below about the Demented Ratling 
and causing commotion in Dwarftown.


2.5.3 Thrundarr

Thrundarr is the village elder. He can provide background information on a variety of 
subjects, none of which is really crucial to completing the game. He assigns six lawful 
quests regardless of alignment. They are listed in the next section.

2.5.3.1 Thrundarr's quests, their rewards and the significance of the rewards

Several quests are available from Thrundarr once the PC achieves experience level six.  
Talking to Thrundarr about 'quest' provides access to them:

The first five quests are available in this order:


1) Slay a random creature.  This can be a very annoying quest.  Thrundarr can assign 
   anything ranging from a goblin to a Ghost Lord.  The reward is having the PC's entire 
   inventory identified or the (artifact) potion of literacy for illiterate characters.

2) Find out what is beyond the animated forest.  The PC has two choices here: traverse the 
   animated forest or bypass it and descend through the Dwarven Halls.  See section 
   2.5.3.1.1 below about these locations.  The reward for this quest is a blessed wand of 
   fireballs with twelve charges.  This comes in very handy in the Pyramid (see section 
   2.9).

   WARNING:   

   Be very careful when wandering around below Dwarftown before receiving this quest.  
   Entering the Animated Forest for even a single turn before the quest is assigned 
   results in Thrundarr refusing to assign it, instead assigning another random monster 
   quest with *no reward*.  Since the wand of fireballs (blessed with twelve charges, no 
   less) can be very useful, entering the Animated Forest before the quest is assigned is 
   very unwise.  Note that this does not occur if the PC enters the Dwarven Halls.

3) Kill the ogre tribe below Dwarftown - the staircase to this level is generated between 
   the Dwarven Mystic's room and the Green Griffon Inn.  See section 2.5.3.1.2 below about 
   this quest.  The reward is 5000 gold pieces, useful for training with Garth (see 
   section 2.5.5).

4) Become the Champion of the Arena - if the PC is already the Champion of the Arena, 
   another random monster quest is assigned - a very good reason *not* to become the 
   Champion until this quest is assigned.  Instead of a cash reward, the PC is given an 
   artifact sword, the Golden Gladius, for winning the 20th Arena fight.  Thrundarr's 
   rewards for this quest are usually pieces of equipment which vary according to the 
   class of the PC and possibly the RNG.  A couple of examples:

       A mindcrafter (probably) received:

       blessed mithril cap [+0, +2]                         [40s]
       blessed adamantium chain mail (-1, -3) [-1, +8]     [288s]
       blessed mithril girdle [+0, +2]                      [20s]
       blessed adamantium long sword (+0, 1d8+5)            [28s]
       blessed medium mithril shield [+5, +1]               [80s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       blessed adamantium boots [+0, +3]                    [89s]

       A wizard and a beastfighter both received:

       heap of 8 blessed bandages                           [16s]
       blessed waterproof blanket                           [10s]
       blessed fireproof blanket                            [10s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       heap of 5 uncursed potions of extra healing          [10s]
       uncursed potion of gain attributes                    [4s]
       uncursed potion of ultra healing                      [2s]
       blessed scroll of familiar summoning                  [2s]

   The bandages, blankets, etc. seem to be the most common set of equipment received as a 
   reward for this quest.

   These are nice enough, but of no great consequence in the context of the whole game.  
   Of greater importance is the fact that the PC now has the Golden Gladius.  It can be 
   exchanged for training with Bart the grizzled gladiator.  See section 2.5.7.1 below.

   It is also possible under some circumstances to receive the artifact dwarven shield 
   "Rolf's Saviour" as a reward for this quest.  Lawful alignment is probably a 
   requirement alomg with cooperation from the RNG.
   
5) Slay a greater daemon that has been terrorizing Dwarftown.  The daemon can be a 
   difficult opponent, particularly if it becomes entangled with the dwarves in the city.  
   Bear in mind the fact that the greater daemon can kill NPCs who may be helpful later.  
   This includes the demented ratling, which destroys the possibility of any special ending.  
   The greater daemon breathes fire and is a stat drainer.  It can be sacrificed on the 
   altar in Dwarftown.  If the PC is lucky enough to have found demon slaying ammo, use 
   it!  There will be more found later.  The reward for this quest is the artifact mace 
   Big Punch, which many PCs find useless because it is so heavy - 800 stones.  It is 
   potential sacrificial fodder.

Thrundarr's sixth quest, available at any time and often taken out of order by many 
players, is to free the spirit of Griff Bloodax, a dwarven hero who has been turned into 
an undead dwarven chaos berserker by the master necromancer Nonnak. It is necessary to ask 
him about 'portal' to obtain this quest. In return for completing this quest, Thrundarr 
provides some equipment rewards (see section 2.7) and more importantly opens the dwarven 
portal leading to the deeper CoC. Note that it is not strictly necessary to do this quest. 
Thrundarr stands on a lever that controls the portal. If he is removed from that location, 
the PC can 'h'andle the lever himself. Methods for accomplishing this include teleporting 
Thrundarr, confusing him and killing him.

Thrundarr is teleportation resistant, thus using charges from a wand of teleportation is 
not recommended unless there is no alternative. A PC with the Teleportation spell has no 
problem. Teleporting him causes no alignment drop; Thrundarr does not become hostile and 
he will still assign quests. Killing him is a rather drastic act with all sorts of 
negative consequences. Using ventriloquism on him is fairly easy, confuses him and causes 
him to wander off the lever. It causes an alignment drop roughly equivalent to killing him 
but does not curse or doom the PC nor are muscular dwarves summoned. It does make 
Thrundarr hostile after he recovers from his confusion. This causes an amusing scenario as 
the non-hostile dwarves encounter a hostile Thrundarr wandering around Dwarftown chasing 
the PC.

The PC should actually do the quest unless there is a very specific reason not to do so, 
since there are very useful artifacts generated during the quest. See section 2.7 for more 
about this quest.


2.5.3.1.1 The animated forest and the Dwarven Halls

Thrundarr asks the PC to pass through the Animated Forest and find out what lies beyond. 
He also mentions a possibly dangerous shortcut which turn out to be the Dwarven Halls 
DH: 1 and DH: 2. On approximately D: 15 there will be a level that has two down 
staircases. One leads to the Animated Forest, the other to the Dwarven Halls. It is 
impossible to tell them apart. 

Passing through the Animated Forest is a test of one's patience among other things. The 
entire level is filled with living trees milling about. The majority are not hostile but 
will of course become hostile if attacked. It is difficult to get through them without 
accidentally hitting one or more. When the PC encounters hostile trees it is best not to 
try to fight them but rather keep moving. In fact it is usually best to be as defensive as 
possible and forget about offense completely: wield two shields and use Coward tactics. 
The hostile trees will usually be left behind in the crowd. It seems to be best to keep 
moving in any case and refrain from resting on one square. Invisibility is a tremendous 
asset in the Animated Forest, but PCs usually do not have it available at this stage of 
the game. One thing to avoid entirely is any kind of fire magic in the forest. The whole 
forest becomes hostile.

The alternative to the tedium of the Animated Forest is a descent through the Dwarven 
Halls. This is much faster but potentially dangerous. Very out-of-depth monsters can be 
generated in the Dwarven Halls. If the PC has invisibility, seven league boots or anything 
that increases speed, wear them before entering in case it becomes necessary to flee. 
Exploring other than finding the down stairways is highly inadvisable.

Both of these locations can be problematic. The Animated Forest is always incredibly 
tedious. The Dwarven Halls can be a cakewalk if the PC is lucky enough to have the 
stairways generated close together. They can also be a virtual instadeath if a very nasty 
monster shows up. As Thrundarr says, "It's yer choice."


2.5.3.1.2 The Ogre Cave

There is an ogre tribe below Dwarftown which Thrundarr asks the PC to eliminate. This 
quest is relatively easy compared to getting through the Animated Forest or Dwarven Halls. 
The ordinary ogres have no special attacks and the PC should be able to bash them with 
brute force combined with missile attacks or blast them with magic. Weaker races might 
find a corpse or two that grants a strength increase. A potential problem is the ogre magi 
present on the level. They are capable of becoming invisible and casting Frost Bolt. PCs 
who have no cold resistance need to watch out for them. Wear an amulet of the cold heart 
if the PC has one. There are also a couple of ogre lords present, which are tougher than 
the ordinary ogres.


2.5.4 The Dwarven Mystic

The Dwarven Mystic is found in a 2 x 2 sealed room east of the room containing the altar. 
The most common way to get in is by teleporting. The Dwarven Mystic used to be a 
guaranteed source of the artifact dwarven rune axe Rolf's Companion for non-chaotics. In 
g16p2 he may give lawfuls the axe. Neutrals never receive the axe but rather some 
equipment which varies. It can be four scrolls of chaos resistance and/or seven blessed 
potions of insight, potions of extra healing or other equipment. Several gammas ago, 
Rolf's Companion was a very powerful artifact. In recent gammas, it has been weakened to 
the point that many players regard the possibility of getting four scrolls of chaos 
resistance from the Dwarven Mystic as an argument for neutral alignment at this point in 
the game. Chaotics will receive nothing from him. He responds with the message "It wasn't 
you I've been waiting for!"

Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to and within the 
dwarven mystic's room. However, this is only possible if Dwarftown is generated on D: 11.:

  .....^
  .####.
  .#.^#.
  .#^.#.
  .####.
  ^.....

The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created.

It is also possible to open the walls of the Dwarven Mystic's room with a wand of 
destruction. This is somewhat dangerous, since nearby townspeople, and perhaps the 
Dwarven Mystic himself, may be damaged by the blast, causing some, or all, inhabitants of 
Dwarftown to become hostile. If the player is careful, it is possible to destroy the 
walls, 'C'hat with the Dwarven Mystic and receive his rewards in the usual manner.

If a PC with non-chaotic alignment has committed a crime in Dwarftown which results in an 
alarm gong being rung and muscular dwarves being summoned, the Dwarven Mystic responds 
with a different message "Ye art doomed!" This does not result in the PC gaining the 
cursed or doomed intrinsics. A wished-for Dwarven Mystic also always responds with this 
message.


2.5.5 Garth and Training

Garth is the dwarven weaponmaster found in the training hall east of Thrundarr's room. 
Garth will train all stats except Appearance and Mana. The formula for how much to pay 
is $100 * stat value, doubled once for each 5 points over 15. Here are examples of what 
to pay Garth: 

Stat score    Payment

   1-15          100 -   1500gp (100x)
  16-20         3200 -   4000gp (200x)
  21-25         8400 -  10000gp (400x)
  26-30        20800 -  24000gp (800x)
  31-35        49600 -  56000gp (1600x)
  36-40       115200 - 128000gp (3200x)
  41-45       262400 - 288000gp (6400x)
  46-50       588800 - 640000gp (12800x)

Note that the effects of training do not happen instantaneously. The stat has simply been 
trained. The game checks every so often (and always when gaining an experience level) to 
see if a stat is eligible for an increase. This is when the stat will rise. Note also that 
it is possible to pay Garth once and receive several stat increases as a result. This is 
particularly useful for those PC's with a very low stat score in one or more categories. 
Paying Garth well in excess of the amount needed to raise the stat will result in multiple 
stat increases over time.

Note that there is a manual entry under the Attributes section that states the following:

"The potential maximum attribute scores are based on the initial attribute scores. The 
maximum for an attribute is dependent on the base score and the player race. These 
maximums can only rarely be surpassed by natural training. This is a long and arduous 
process. Only magical methods can exceed these limits with ease."

This seems to imply that Garth cannot train a stat beyond its natural maximum. This may 
be true under "reasonable" circumstances. Giving Garth massive amounts of gold may be a 
different story.


2.5.6 Glod and Smithing

Glod, the dwarven smith in Dwarftown, will teach the Smithing skill.  There is a price for 
this which seems to depend on Charisma,  Appearance or both.  The base price seems to vary 
from as low as 800 to as high as 20000 gold pieces, and seems to be heavily influenced by 
race.

Glod is also capable of removing rust from rusted items and fixing certain broken items, 
notably pickaxes, again, for a price.  It has been reported that after removing rust from 
an item a number of times, Glod will offer to rustproof the item.

After learning the Smithing skill, Glod will make his equipment available to the PC for 
a price, typically 2500 gold pieces.

It is possible to teleport Glod away from his smithy, although the details (wand of 
teleportation vs the Teleportation spell) have yet to be worked out. He wanders in 
Dwarftown but still asks for the nominal 2500 gold piece fee (seemingly telepathically, 
probably a bug) after this. However, at this point, he can be lured off the level if he 
is adjacent to a staircase, like any other inhabitant of Dwarftown. After Glod is left 
on another level, his demands for payment cease. Note that this may involve considerable 
tedium as the PC attempts to lure Glod off the level.

It is possible to kill Glod without making the rest of Dwarftown hostile, thus making 
his smithy available for free. One method of doing this involves using the greater daemon 
generated by Thrundarr's fifth quest. If the greater daemon is lured near Glod, it will 
kill Glod.


2.5.7 The Green Griffon Inn

The Green Griffon Inn holds two useful NPCs described below. It is located in the 
southeast corner of Dwarftown.


2.5.7.1 Bart

Bart provides teaching in three skills: Backstabbing, Tactics and Two Weapon Combat in 
exchange for the Golden Gladius, the artifact sword provided as a reward for winning 
the 20th Arena fight. Tactics is available only from him. He also provides some training 
in weapon skills, raising all zero level skills to level one and providing small bonuses 
to other weapon skils. The number of weapon marks that he gives seems to be (learning 
score)d10. The training in weapon skills is secondary as compared to granting the Tactics 
skill, which is of much greater importance in the game.


2.5.7.2 Torgall

Torgall is the innkeeper in the Green Griffon Inn. He is a source of rumors, for the price 
of an ale.


2.5.8 The Demented Ratling

The Demented Ratling is an important NPC for all PCs trying for a special ending. He 
demands to be fed six artifacts in exchange for revealing the secret of the Stone Circle, 
where the Crown of Chaos can be found. He will only talk to chaotic PCs. He becomes much 
more powerful each time he is fed an artifact. This is important to remember. If the PC 
is going to cause commotion in Dwarftown, for example in order to fulfill Kherab's second 
quest, it should only be done after feeding a number of artifacts to the demented ratling. 
Otherwise the demented ratling may be killed in the ensuing battle for control of 
Dwarftown.

A wished-for demented ratling will make the usual demand for six artifacts from a chaotic 
PC, but will not eat an artifact.  Instead, he responds with "Ya naw will neeta die!"  He 
is not necessarily hostile after this.

It is possible to anger the demented ratling to the point where he will attack by 
repeatedly (about five times) talking to him after giving him artifacts.


2.6 The Old Barbarian's Glade

The Old Barbarian can be found in a clearing in the center of the wilderness map. He 
assigns a quest to kill a score (20) of the monsters the PC first killed. As a reward for 
successfully completing the quest he teaches the Courage skill. The quest is only 
available to non-chaotics and is not available until the PC has killed 500 monsters.  
Note that if the PC somehow acquires the Courage skill after the quest is assigned but 
before it is completed (bard class power, potion of education), returns to the Old 
Barbarian and 'C'hats with him, he is surprised and gives the PC an ordinary two-handed 
sword.

For more about strategy for the first kill, see section 0.9.1.

Note that the Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items. He is the only 
monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly generated is going to run 
away with the PC's stuff. If the PC leaves items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will 
not have time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.


2.7 The Dwarven Graveyard

The Dwarven Graveyard is located in the southeastern mountains of the wilderness map. It 
cannot be found until the PC talks to Thrundarr about "portal". The portal seals the 
lower parts of the CoC until the PC finishes this quest or removes Thrundarr from his 
location in Dwarftown and 'h'andles the lever controlling the portal. It is most 
definitely worth doing the quest, since two artifacts can be found in the graveyard.

There have been conflicting reports about the rewards Thrundarr provides for accomplishing 
this quest. It is always equipment, though the status varies. Whether holy water is poured 
on Griff's grave seems to make little difference in this preliminary examination:

Griff destroyed in melee, no holy water poured on grave:

uncursed wand of digging (0 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 6 blessed potions of extra healing

a different PC, same scenario:

uncursed wand of digging (5 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 3 blessed potions of extra healing

Griff destroyed in melee, poured holy water on grave afterwards:

uncursed wand of digging (5 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (3 charges)
heap of 4 blessed potions of extra healing

Griff destroyed by pouring holy water on grave:

blessed wand of digging (2 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (2 charges)
heap of 8 blessed potions of extra healing

Using holy water on Griff's grave produces the message:

You pour some water on the ground. You are overcome by feelings of gratefulness.


2.7.1 Surface level

The surface level of the graveyard is an open plain inhabited by many, many undead. There 
are skeletons, zombies, ghuls, shadows and wights present. This is also probably the first 
time the player finds graves. Most of the graves are not of much importance, but some of 
them will contain the inscription "Great treasures are buried here." This inscription 
needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It is indeed possible to find an outstanding item, 
up to and including artifacts, in a grave marked with that inscription, but it is rare. 
Digging up graves is a chaotic act, and will always summon some kind of guardian. These 
range from lesser undead, guarding the ordinary graves, to very dangerous greater undead 
such as ghost kings and emperor lichs guarding the "Great treasures are buried here." 
graves. It is probably not worth trying to dig up the "great treasures" graves with a 
level 13-17 PC. The PC can always return later if desired. All of this regarding digging 
graves assumes the PC has a means of digging. The available methods are a pickaxe, a wand 
of digging and the Mystic Shovel spell. There is a guaranteed pickaxe in the Pyramid for 
PCs at experience level 13 - 16 (see section 2.9).

If the PC has a limited supply of undead slaying ammo use it very sparingly, if at all. It 
will be needed in the underground level.

The center of the plain contains a small building that leads to the underground level.


2.7.2 Underground level

The underground level of the dwarven graveyard contains a labyrinth which features many 
traps. It is very wise to have the Detect Traps skill while navigating this maze. Use the 
's'earch command constantly if the PC has the Detect Traps skill. The left side of the 
screen is the problematic area regarding traps. The right side of the screen is Griff's 
tomb, which has been taken over by Nonnak, the master necromancer. It contains a large 
number of undead, including ghosts, wraiths, Griff Bloodax the undead dwarven chaos 
berserker and Nonnak himself.

There are two artifacts hidden in Nonnak's lair. The elemental gauntlets are found in a 
hidden room in the center of the eastern wall. They are guarded by a bone golem and are 
almost always located on a trap. The bone golem is not difficult to defeat for a PC that 
has made it through the dwarven graveyard. The Sword of Nonnak is located in Griff 
Bloodax's grave in the center of Nonnak's lair. It is necessary to have some means of 
digging to retrieve it. The sword is quite important for wizards, mindcrafters and other 
classes dependent upon Willpower. It grants +5 to Willpower. Note that digging up Griff's 
grave to retrieve the sword is a chaotic act, like any grave digging.


2.7.2.1 Griff Bloodax

Griff Bloodax, the undead chaos dwarven berserker, is a brute force opponent. He does not 
seem to have any special attacks, though his melee attack is formidable for a level 13 PC. 
Note that Griff is teleportation resistant.  Therefore simply trying to teleport him away 
in order to reach his grave and 'u'se holy water will not work.  Using undead slaying ammo 
is very effective against him, while melee with a low-teens experience level PC may be 
difficult.


2.7.2.2 Nonnak

Nonnak is the master necromancer that created the undead guarding the tomb. He is 
vulnerable to fire-based attacks. He uses Frost Bolt as an offensive spell and has a 
mediocre melee attack. PCs without cold resistance will have a very hard time defeating 
him. He is also a summoner.


2.8 The Mad Minstrel

The Mad Minstrel lives in a hut in a clearing found in the northern central part of the 
wilderness map. He will sing songs which are somewhat cryptic hints about important parts 
of the game. If a player wants to finish the game without reading extensive spoilers, it 
is very important to sit through his concerts until the player has memorized everything 
he has to say. Alternatively, they are reproduced here along with [some interpretation]:


 "The Lord of the Cats is a touchy fellow,
His teeth are sharp and his eyes are yellow.
  All kinds of cats he calls his subjects,
  Small ones, big ones, all he'll protect.
       If kind ye be to cats, I sing,
      Talk from him his precious ring!"

[reference to the Cat Lord and felines; see section 0.9.2]

    "Felines have a shiny fur.
When you feed them, they will purr.
  True cat-lovers never harm them,
 some musicians try to charm them.
 For all others, let me warn them:
  As soon as felines meet disaster
 their energy rejoins their master."

[more reference to the Cat Lord and felines]

    "Heaven help you in the tower of hell,
The elements will surely sound your death-knell,
 If walking on fire still shrouds you in pain,
  You might just need some more of the same..."

[Tower of Eternal Flames; have two fire resistance sources 
beyond the intrinsic, which counts as two]

      "In a very hot tower
  your points in life get lower.
Resisting fire not once but twice
       Would be very wise."

[Tower of Eternal Flames; have two fire resistance 
 sources beyond the intrinsic, which counts as two]

       "A drakelings scales may be crimson red
       if a creature of fire for dinner he had
    he may wear tough scales and two rings to boot
      he may have the armour and all of the loot
          but fire is still a hazard to him
  cause a drakeling will start to burn from within.

     He will become fast, even fast as the light
  his foes may run screaming at this unearthly sight
      as quicklings so fast, he may just become
      but the hazard of fire will never be gone
  cause the speed makes him dizzy and dazy and that
  and no ring and no scales will save him from that.

      So the tower of fire is a dangerous thing
and you should really listen to the sound of my string
   for a drakeling has really a hard time in there
   without healing and stuff he won't get anywhere.
      So a potion or herb might be a good boon,
 but if you enter without them - you are just a loon!"

    To show the mighty champion who's earned the right of passage.
    For only one you'll step aside and cease your faithful vigil:
 The one who wears your brother's ring emblazed with Heaven's sigil.""

The Mad Minstrel is also a critical part of the special endings. More about his role in 
the special endings can be found in section 4.3.1.2.


2.9 The Pyramid

The pyramid is located in the wilderness, slightly east of the exact center of the map. 
It can be entered once the PC reaches experience level 13. When this happens, the game 
generates a message: "You suddenly feel ancient magical energies manifest in your 
vicinity." Searching the current location will reveal the papyrus scroll, which is an 
invitation to enter the pyramid. It is not necessary to read, or even find, the scroll 
for admission to the pyramid. It asks the PC to come as soon as possible. Do not be 
fooled by this. It is best to wait as long as possible before entering the pyramid, since 
it is a rather nasty place. The entrance to the pyramid closes permanently if the PC 
reaches experience level 17. Ideally the PC should reach experience level 16 and keep 
very careful track of his experience points. Approach the pyramid when the PC is close to 
achieving level 17, within a couple hundred points. Wander around in the vicinity of the 
pyramid to generate wilderness encounters. Killing monsters in the wilderness should 
enable the player to fine-tune his experience score to the point where very few additional 
points are needed to achieve level 17. Then enter the pyramid. The first couple of kills 
in the pyramid will raise the PC to experience level 17, maximizing the chances of success 
in the pyramid. Keep a *very* close eye on those experience points. You don't want to 
accidentally achieve level 17 and have the pyramid close, because Rehetep carries two 
artifacts.


2.9.1 The first two levels

The first level of the pyramid has the following layout:


 ###########                              #######
 #.........#      ############            #.....#             #######

     ####################       ##############                 ###


The numeral 1 is used to indicate the presence of a secret door. Note the traps. These are 
guaranteed traps. There will also be a number of non-guaranteed traps present. The 
location of the non-guaranteed traps changes from game to game. Also note the tools 
represented by the ( symbol. This cache of tools is guaranteed and includes thieves' 
picks, a climbing set and a pickaxe. The tools are always located on top of a trap.
The inhabitants of this level include (greater) mummies, ghosts, spectres, jackal demons, 
jackalweres, jackals and hyenas. Mummies can cause sickness. It is very unwise to enter 
the pyramid without some means of dealing with sickness. The fastest and easiest way to 
cure sickness is with blessed or uncursed curaria mancox herbs.

The second level of the pyramid has the following layout:


   ###         ###### #######
   #.###########....# #^^^^^#
   #....^.....##.######1###^#####

#####.....##.#.#.######.......#
  #...###.##.######.....###.###
  ##### #.....#   #.##### #.#
        #######   ###     ###


Again the numeral 1 indicates secret doors. This level is very similar to the first level 
in terms of monsters and traps. There is no guaranteed equipment here.


2.9.2 The top level

The top level of the pyramid has the following layout:


      #######
     ##..Z..##
    ##.......##
#####&.......&#####
#Z@.............@Z#

     #########


There is a unique feature on this level. The down staircase, represented by the > symbol, 
changes location randomly once when the PC enters the level. This forces the PC to fight 
his way to the new location if a retreat is necessary. Furthermore, the monsters on the 
level will not follow the PC down the stairs. In older gammas of ADOM, it was possible to 
lure the monsters down the stairs one at a time and dispatch them. It doesn't work in 
current versions of the game.

The Z at the top represents Rehetep, the Mummy Lord. The remaining Zs are mummies. The & 
characters are jackal demons, which have a confusion attatck. The @ characters represent 
a random monster, generally somewhat out of depth, but not terribly so. Bear in mind that 
mummies see invisible. If the PC is fortunate enough to have a means of invisibility at 
this point, use it and take out the mummies first.


2.9.2.1 Rehetep

Rehetep the Mummy Lord holds two powerful artifacts, the Ankh and the Ancient Mummy 
Wrapping. A Greater Identify of each is below:

----------------- blessed ancient mummy wrapping [+1, +5] {Ap-8}---------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +1 and PV by +5.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

It modifies your appearance attribute by -8.
It grants resistance to sleep attacks.
It grants resistance to stunning.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
It grants IMMUNITY to cold attacks.

--------------------------------- uncursed ankh--------------------------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +2.
When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It increases your luck.
It grants luck.
It makes Fate smile upon you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the [+2, +2] nature of the Ankh is not revealed explicitly except when Greater 
Identified. Note also that it not only grants the Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics, but 
also increases luck, a hidden property used by the game when calculating dice rolls, etc.

The artifact Ancient Mummy Wrapping is the only mummy wrapping that weighs 60 stones. Be 
sure not to confuse it with other mummy wrappings. They are all described as a "strange 
wrapping" prior to identification. The resistances granted by the Ancient Mummy Wrapping 
are considerable and should give clues about how to attack Rehetep. Using cold based 
attacks is, of course, useless. Rehetep and other mummies are vulnerable to fire. This is 
where the wand of fireballs available from Thrundarr as a quest reward comes in very 
handy. Do not give up when messages about Rehetep "shrugging off" fire based attacks are 
generated. He will succumb to repeated fire attacks. All mummies including Rehetep are 
vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course.

Note that the combination of cold immunity and the see invisible intrinsic available from 
the Ancient Mummy Wrapping makes Li-Hon-Kay, a potential 20th Arena fight opponent, much 
easier to defeat.


2.10 The Gremlin Cave

The Gremlin Cave is located in the southwest corner of the Drakalor Chain. It contains 
guaranteed items: the Phial of Caladriel, which is an artifact potion, fluff balls, which 
turn into gremlins when exposed to water, and a climbing set. There are messages generated 
when the PC enters the Gremlin Cave: "You feel watched. You shiver. You shiver really bad! 
It's dark here!". The Gremlin Cave is dark and filled with water traps, which, when 
triggered by the gremlins, cause them to multiply. Things can get out of control quickly in 
this cave due to the rapid replication of the gremlins. The objective is to retrieve the 
Phial of Caladriel and optionally the climbing set. There is another guaranteed climbing 
set in the Pyramid (section 2.9). The Phial is located in the farthest possible corner 
from the entrance.

The cave is dark and gremlins are damaged by the Light spell and wands of light. An amulet 
of light, a torch, adequate castings of the Light spell or many wands of light are 
necessary simply to see and navigate the cave. The spell or wands can also be used to kill 
gremlins. If the PC is fairly buff, the Gremlin Cave can be used to train weapon skills, 
since a potentially infinite number of gremlins will be generated. They are not 
particularly difficult for a mid-level PC to kill until the PC has killed thousands.

Since there are a potentially endless number of gremlins available, it is also possible to 
use the Pick Pockets skill indefinitely. This will both train the skill and satisfy Yergius 
regarding the PC's proficiency as a thief. Bear in mind also the always-present possibilty 
of pickpocketing a truly outstanding item. While it is very rare, artifacts have been 
pickpocketed this way.

Note that it is in no way necessary to enter this cave to complete the game. It is simply 
a source of an expendable artifact which can be sacrificed, given to the demented ratling 
or sold. The climbing set is also useful of course, especially if the PC has missed the 
opportunity to enter the Pyramid.


2.11 The Assassins' Guild

The Assassins' Guild is located in the wilderness, west of the river that divides the 
Drakalor Chain. The entrance is described as "A rather boring cave entrance." It consists 
of three levels.


2.11.1 The DDL

The first level is named the DDL and contains no unique special features, although it may 
contain any of the normal dungeon features: traps, herbs, rivers, etc.


2.11.2 The VDDL

Upon entering the second level, the message "This dungeon is very dusty." is generated. 
This level contains many, many teleportation traps and can be annoying without teleport 
control. It also contains one guaranteed item: a wand of teleportation. The wand is always 
next to the down staircase found on the level in a 1 x 2 room that is separated from the 
rest of the level. It can only be reached by digging or teleportation. In practice, the 
easiest way to find the down staircase is to zap a wand of item detection. This will reveal 
the location of the wand, which the PC can then dig or teleport to, thus revealing the 
staircase. Note that it is possible for a monster to be standing on the wand, so 
teleportation may fail.


2.11.2.1 The hidden stairway and how to descend

The hidden down staircase in the VDDL is like no other in the game. It is itself a 
teleportation trap and will attempt to teleport the PC away when he tries to descend. 
Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating without teleport control. There is a 
requirement to trigger a certain number of teleportation traps on the level before the PC 
can descend. This can be done with either the normal teleportation traps or the staircase 
itself. However, it is much more efficient to use teleportation traps that are far away 
from the down staircase. They are up to six times faster at increasing the count of 
unsuccessful attempts. Just keep trying until the PC receives the message "You suddenly 
feel attuned to this area in a very special way." It is then possible to descend.


2.11.3 The final level

The final level of the Assassins' Guild has no proper name; it is only named with four 
question marks: "????". There are definite precautions necessary on this level. The PC 
initially descends into a 3 x 3 room containing four assassins. The assassins are not 
particularly dangerous opponents, although they use poison. There is a safe passage 
available through the level which is free of traps, otherwise the level is full of traps. 
The PC *must* not use missile weapons on the level. If he does, a general alarm is sounded 
and the Assassin Prince, who is very important to the special endings, becomes hostile and 
refuses to give quests later in the game. Likewise, a failed pickpocket attempt will raise 
the general alarm. Also be careful during the melee. If an assassin panics, leave him 
alone. Attacking panic-stricken assassins will also make the Assassin Prince hostile. In 
their panicked state, they make begin attacking each other or the Assassin Prince himself. 
Pay no attention to them. The level contains assassins, master assasins, holy slayers, 
gray slayers, muggers, dopplegangers and doppleganger lords.

Teleportation is not allowed on this level.

Obviously, there are some nasty monsters here and there is no particular objective for 
low-level PCs, other than killing the monsters for experience. The PC may elect to skip 
this level until much later in the game.


2.11.3.1 The Assassin Prince

The Assassin Prince is the source of the Filk Quest, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel. This 
quest is only necessary for the Ultra endings. See section 4.3.1.1 for a description of 
this quest and its requirements. If a PC is not planning to do an Ultra ending, it may be 
worth killing the Assassin Prince for the artifact dagger Sting, which he carries. Note 
two things: the Assassin Prince has been described as the offspring of a moloch and a 
quickling queen - he's not quite that bad, but he is a very difficult opponent - and 
second, Sting is really only worth acquiring if the PC has or plans to obtain its 
companion dagger Needle, available from Sharad-Waador (see section 3.9).


2.12 The Tomb of the High Kings


The Tomb of the High Kings is located in a dungeon found in the northwest corner of the 
Drakalor Chain. The PC must have a climbing set to reach it (and to leave that section of 
the map). The fact that a climbing set is required means that the PC must do some work to 
find one prior to entering the dungeon. This ensures that brand new PCs do not enter this 
location. The dungeon consists of two normal levels followed by three cavernous levels 
leading to the tomb. The cavernous levels are somewhat challenging, as are most cavernous 
levels.

The tomb itself consists of a short winding corridor leading to a large chamber. The 
chamber contains a lake which is unique in that the water is red rather than blue. This 
should serve as a warning. It is filled with chaos piranhas that deal over 200 points of 
damage during each turn the PC is in the lake. This is the place where the Bridge Building 
skill or the ability to freeze water (yielded by the Terinyo quests) becomes vital.

Teleportation is not allowed on this level, so do not count on it to get your PC out of a 
tight spot.

The PC must build a bridge or create an ice bridge to an island located in the lake. 
Remember that ice bridges will only hold the PC's weight plus 2000 stones before breaking. 
On the island is a 1 x 1 room protected by a locked and trapped door. Upon opening the 
door, a skeletal king is found guarding the Ring of the High Kings. The skeletal king is a 
somewhat nasty foe who is able to confuse the PC. This is not a good thing when the PC is 
perched on a bridge, liable to stumble to certain death in the piranha infested waters 
below. Some means of confusion resistance is therefore highly recommended. The skeletal 
king is immune to the chaos piranahs so luring him into the lake will not kill him. He is 
vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course. He is not difficult to kill in melee for a 
mid-level PC with a decent melee attack.

The objective of this dungeon, the Ring of the High Kings, 
is Greater Identified as follows:

-------------------- blessed ring of the High Kings [+2, +3]-------------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +3.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of 
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points 
of damage.

It grants resistance to fire.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants resistance to cold.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Greater Identify does not reveal the most important property of the ring, however: 
it allows peaceful passage past the Eternal Guardian (see section 3.3).

Here is an ASCII map of the Tomb of the High Kings, showing the shortest route to the 
island formed with an ice bridge:

2.13 The Water Dragon's Lair

The water dragon's lair is located in a random water-containing square of the wilderness. 
It contains Shyssiryxius, the water dragon (Blup's mother), her treasure hoard and various 
other aquatic beasts. It consists of a labyrinth and a central room containing 
Shyssiryxius and the treasure. The entire cave is submerged, so ordinarily some means of 
water breathing and the swimming skill are required. The most common method of obtaining 
water breathing is through a helm of water breathing (generally a "blue helmet" before 
identification). Wearing two rings of the fish also grants this, although they are 
autocursing. If the PC is not born with the swimming skill, it can be obtained from Blup 
by giving him potions of carrot juice. The need for these abilities ordinarily keeps low 
level PCs out of the lair, which is as it should be. The aquatic beasts found in the 
labyrinth are not trivial, especially the dragon turtles. Sharks and giant eels can also 
be found.

In theory a PC with on demand teleportation, high hit points and possibly some regeneration 
could survive a teleport to Shyssiryxius, a chat and a teleport to the up stairs without 
water breathing or swimming.

There are two main reasons for entering. The first is to 'C'hat with Shyssiryxius then 
return to Terinyo. This allows the PC to inform Blup about the location of his mother, 
which results in eventual delivery of the rune-covered trident, a decent artifact weapon 
and missile, later in the game. The trident is delivered not long after reaching character 
level 16 for PCs born in the Raven starsign. Others have to wait until level 36. The 
location of the lair is not decided until the PC starts searching for it, so it is more or 
less possible to place it in a convenient location, such as near Terinyo.

The second reason for entering the lair is to loot it. There are occasionally outstanding 
items found in the treasure hoard. As might be expected, Shyssiryxius does not take kindly 
to thieves and will attack.

Note that delivery of the rune-covered trident is guaranteed once the PC informs Blup of 
Shyssiryxius' location. The PC may then proceed to loot the cave, or indeed even kill 
Shyssiryxius without forfeiting the rune-cavered trident.


2.13.1 Shyssiryxius

Under normal circumstances, Shyssiryxius is not hostile, only intimidating.  If she is 
'C'hatted with, she roars "HAST YE SEEN MY BABY?" (or "*DIE*" if the PC has done something 
to make her hostile).  Whether she is hostile or not, the PC can leave after chatting and 
report back to Blup.  This of course assumes a PC facing her when she is hostile survives 
(see below).  If the PC attempts to steal from her treasure hoard, she gives a warning about 
not picking anything up.  If the PC persists, she will attack.  She is a formidable opponent 
with a reasonably powerful melee attack and a deadly water breath attack that is capable of 
dealing circa 100 points of damage in a single round.  She regenerates and is immune to cold.  
She is capable of teleporting and does so when she panics, making the PC work to find her 
while remaining underwater the whole time.  She can be killed, but it takes an upper level 
PC, and it doesn't hurt to have some blessed potions of extra healing along.


2.14 Khelavaster

Khelavaster is the sage who revealed the prophecy about the coming of chaos. He entered the 
dungeons in the Drakalor Chain never to be seen again. The PC eventually encounters him 
below Dwarftown, after the Dwarven Halls or Animated Forest, generally on D: 16. By this 
time Khelavaster is mortally wounded and surrounded by chaos servants.


2.14.1 Saving Khelavaster

At this time the PC must make a choice about saving Khelavaster. He is on the down 
staircase and it is impossible to descend further without saving him or allowing him to 
die. It is however, possible to ascend, leaving the level in its state as found for an 
indefinite period of time. He can only be saved by giving him an amulet of life saving 
*before* 'C'hatting with him. There is no guaranteed way to obtain an amulet of life saving 
and they are very rare items. If the player is determined to attempt an ultra ending, 
Khelavaster must be saved since he is the only one capable of summoning the Trident of the 
Red Rooster.

Common methods of attempting to get an amulet of life saving include staying in the 
infinite dungeon until one is generated or draining every pool the PC has found in the 
hopes of obtaining a wish. A ring of djinni summoning may also be generated in the infinite 
dungeon, which provides a wish when blessed.


2.14.2 Khelavaster's gifts

In any case, Khelavaster reveals a bit about the plot of the game including the existence 
of the chaos orbs and their general locations. He also leaves some equipment for the PC. 
The equipment he leaves depends on whether he is saved or dies. The equipment is 
guaranteed, but if he is allowed to die the exact status varies. Three examples are shown 
below.

cursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +2] {Dx +2}
blessed amulet of protection +2
uncursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
cursed wand of digging (4 charges)
cursed potion of invisibility
474 gold pieces

uncursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+5}
uncursed amulet of protection +2
uncursed eternium dagger (+1, 2d4+7)
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)
uncursed potion of invisibility
271 gold pieces

uncursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+2}
uncursed amulet of protection +2
cursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)
cursed potion of invisibility
406 gold pieces

If Khelavaster is saved, the equipment he leaves is (almost) exactly the same every time:

blessed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
blessed wand of digging (8 charges)
heap of 4 blessed potions of ultra healing
heap of 6 blessed scrolls of chaos resistance
blessed spellbook of Identify
blessed spellbook of Teleportation

Note the quality of this equipment. The six blessed scrolls of chaos resistance alone are 
roughly equal to two wishes. Thus it is definitely worth spending a wish to obtain an 
amulet of life saving for Khelavaster.

The exact stats of the eternium dagger may vary. A recent report (Feb 26, 2001) revealed 
that the dagger may be as good as (+0, 2d4+10).

If Khelavaster is saved, he reappears in invisible form in Terinyo late in the game. If the 
PC gives him the crumpled scroll, obtained by killing the Emperor Moloch, he will summon 
the TotRR for non-chaotics. There is apparently an experience level requirement in order 
for Khelavaster to appear in Terinyo, but the PC does not need to have the crumpled scroll.


2.15 The CoC Graveyard

The graveyard level in the CoC is found on D: 17. The layout is as follows:

The northern tunnel contains ghuls, skeletons, zombies, shadows, wights and wraiths. 
Ghosts may pass through the walls into this corridor. The central room contains, in 
addition, more dangerous undead: corpse fiends, ghosts, lichs, mummies and greater 
mummies, skeletal warriors, spectres and vampires. The monsters here who see invisible 
are: mummies, greater mummies and lichs.

The graves are diggable. See section 2.7 concerning digging up graves. See Appendix J for 
monster characteristics.


2.16 The Water Temple

The Water Temple, found on either D: 19 or D: 20, is the first elemental temple that most 
PCs will encounter. The layout, on the left side of the level, is as follows:


   ##########################            #######

   ##########################                        ########### #######


The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging.  Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the traps. Note 
the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the 
orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are 
very dangerous. The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC 
instantly should he step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of 
Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in 
the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Water Temple are 
arrayed as follows:

They are: s - water snakes
          x - water grues
          & - water demons
          C - chaos servants
          E - water elementals
          s - (in the center) Snake from Beyond


To attack the temple, the PC must dig in, have a means of crossing the water, then attack 
the monsters. They are all vulnerable to fire based attacks. The grues and demons in 
particular are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee attack that has a very 
high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them eventually - a good reason to 
develop the PCs missile weapon skills. The snakes, including the Snake from Beyond, are 
poisonous. Invisibility is tremendously useful. The only monster found here who sees 
invisible is the Snake from Beyond.


2.16.1 The Snake from Beyond

The Snake from Beyond has been beefed up in recent gammas and is now a formidable opponent. 
It generally does not kill a PC that has made it this far, but has nasty poisonous and 
corrupting attacks that rarely miss. If possible, it should be killed from a distance, 
easier said than done in the close quarters of the Water Temple. Unfortunately, it is not 
vulnerable to any type of slaying ammo.

An examination of the Snake from Beyond with a blessed stethoscope reveals:

You examine the Snake from Beyond. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 45, PV: 22, 
Hits: 477, Attacks: 1, Damage: 12-56. Speed: 101.

Very high hitpoints and formidable DV/PV for a PC at this level.

The Snake from Beyond holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Water, 
greater identified as follows:

----------------- uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10}----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points of damage. 
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +10.

(full heal + corruption when 'U'sed)


2.17 The Banshee


The Banshee is found on a level ranging from D: 22-24. She is an undead spirit in ghost 
form. She pines for her lost husband. Her wail is instantly fatal to most who hear it. 
PCs can prevent this in two ways. The first is by 'U'sing beeswax. This plugs the PC's 
ears, making him deaf until it is removed with the 'E' clean ears command. The second is 
by drinking a potion of deafness. Potions of deafness wear off, but the effects of an 
uncursed potion of deafness will last long enough to kill the Banshee. Using either method, 
the Banshee can then be attacked safely.

The Banshee is always found in a room in the center of the level.

Alternatively, a male character can wield a wedding ring. In this case the PC in question 
still hears the Banshee's wail, but it does not damage the PC. The Banshee is still 
hostile, however. The Banshee's wail is displayed to a male PC wielding a wedding ring as 
follows by the game:

The Banshee regards you in astonishment. "My beloooovvveed huuuusbaaaaaaaaaaannnd!"

Beware of trying to lead the Banshee around while wielding a wedding ring.  While her wail 
can be exploited (see below), this is a dangerous practice.  The wedding ring only works 
while the Banshee can see the PC, so leaving her line of sight for even a single turn can 
be fatal.

The Banshee routinely shrugs off bolt spells, but can eventually be killed using them. She 
is not difficult to kill in melee.

Players have exploited the properties of the Banshee by having her follow a deaf PC around. 
Her wail kills many monsters. A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup (January 16th, 2001) 
reveals that the trees in the animated forest are vulnerable to the Banshee's wail. As 
might be imagined, dozens of trees dying every few turns leads to some very nice treasure. 
The downside is that the Banshee will become very experienced very quickly, thus making her 
much more difficult to dispatch should the need arise. NPCs known to be immune to her wail 
include Waldenbrook, Thrundarr, the Eternal Guardian and the Casino shopkeeper. Banshees 
can be wished for. There have been reports of wished-for Banshees being effective against 
some of the monsters found on D: 50 in gamma 12, but most seem to be immune in later gammas.

A blessed stethoscope is not helpful as far as the Banshee is concerned. The game states 
the Banshee appears to be rather dead. The monster memory contains the following after 
killing the Banshee:


                       <<<<<--- Banshees (G) --->>>>>

The Banshee, a luminous spirit, manages to appear sad and angry at the same
time, obviously a being in an enraged lamentation. Her wail is renowned as it
is filled with such sorrow and hopelessness that most who hear it abandon life
instantly, passing beyond their current pains.

Banshees seem to have a DV of 40. They have a PV of about 2. They seem to
have 187 hitpoints on the average. Usually they attack 2 times. They seem
to have an average speed of about 107.

So far you have killed but one Banshee. One kill on the average seems to be
worth 61779 experience points.


2.18 Darkforge

Darkforge is an important location in the game. It is not a location for low level PCs. 
The entrance to Darkforge is described as "A long and non-descript tunnel." The first 
level of the dungeon is not particularly dangerous except for the presence of a steel 
golem guarding the down staircase. Steel golems are very tough monsters for a mid-level 
PC. If the PC has trouble with the steel golem guarding the down staircase, flee. There 
are many more guarding Darkforge itself. Upon entering Darkforge, the message "You smell 
the reek of sulphur, steel and oil." is generated. The steel golems that guard Darkforge 
are unlife and thus immune to Mindcraft. They are vulnerable to missiles of construct 
slaying, but it is almost unheard of to find enough such ammo to take them all out by this 
point in the game. They are vulnerable to Lightning, from the spell or wand, although it 
will take many castings or charges to kill all of them. Steel golems will shrug off many 
lightning attacks, but can eventually be killed this way. They breathe fire, so both the 
PC and his equipment need to be protected from fire. Many players will attempt Darkforge 
just before assaulting the Tower of Eternal Flames, in order to determine whether their 
PC has a good chance in the ToEF.

Darkforge is a very good way of gaining experience levels for PCs that can deal with the 
steel golems. A typical non-troll PC that manages to clear Darkforge of the initially 
generated steel golems will gain at least five experience levels - very useful when about 
to attempt the ToEF.

Here is an ASCII map of Darkforge. Note the caches of weapons, armor (it is possible to 
obtain artifact weapons and armor from these rooms) and gold, the room containing pools 
(which are not always generated in this pattern), the hidden room containing the Crown of 
Science (the lone [ ), the shortcut to the lower CoC and the nine forges.

It is not wise to spend inordinate amounts of time in Darkforge - for example smithing. 
Darkforge has a higher than normal rate of background corruption.


2.18.1 Kherab

Kherab is the dwarven artificer found in Darkforge. He is presumably the creator of the 
steel golems, steel horrors and animated armors found in Darkforge. He is quite tough, 
with hitpoints numbering in the hundreds and a powerful melee attack. He holds two items 
necessary for smithing: a hammer and an anvil. He is the source of two quests outlined 
below.


2.18.2 Kherab's quests and their rewards

Kherab is the source of two chaotic quests. The first is to kill Guth'Alak, the druid 
found in Terinyo. This of course removes Guth'Alak as a source of potions of cure 
corruption and as the source of the Unicorn quest. Depending on how it is accomplished, 
the entire village of Terinyo may become hostile as well. If this happens, it may destroy 
any chance the PC has to obtain the TotRR. The reward for this quest is the corrupting 
artifact amulet of raw steel. The second quest is to kill Thrundarr, the village elder in 
Dwarftown. This can have all sorts of negative effects as well, including turning all of 
Dwarftown hostile and the killing of the demented ratling. The reward for this quest is 
the corrupting shield of raw steel.

The quest rewards are useful only because they are artifacts. They can be fed to the 
demented ratling, for instance. They are too corrupting to be useful otherwise. These 
"rewards" are not really rewards. Kherab is an evil chaotic being and wants the PC dead. 
Giving away corrupting artifacts is his way of trying to accomplish this.


2.19 The Tower of Eternal Flames

The Tower of Eternal Flames, found in the Wilderness, is probably the nastiest place in 
the game given the experience level of PCs who must visit it. The layout of the Fire 
Temple itself, found on the uppermost of four levels, on the right side of the level, is 
as follows:


  #######
  #.....#                                       #########
  #.>...###       #############          ###### #.......###
  #.......#       #...........#         ##....# ###x......###
  #######.#   #####...........#         #.....#   ###.......#

#########.#####.###...........#          ###..###..........#
#.......#.......# #...........#            ##.#..........###
#.......###.##### ###/#########            ##..............##
#......./...#       #.#                    #................###
#.......##### #######/#####                #........_.........##
#.......#     #...........#            ######..............##..##
#########     #...........#            #....#.##.........#####..#
              #...........#           ##......##.#########  ###.#
              #...........#           #......###........# ###...##
              #...........#           ##....## ####....## #......#
              #############            ######     ######  ########


The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging.  Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the underscore 
in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is 
found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. 
The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should he 
step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which 
means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving 
the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Fire Temple are arrayed as follows:.


  #######
  #.....#                                       #########
  #.>...###       #############          ###### #xxxxxxx###

              #############            ######     ######  ########


PCs are denied entrance to the lower CoC until they have the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, 
held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm in the ToEF, and the game stalls at this point. PCs can 
continue to gain experience levels by staying on available cavernous levels (for instance) 
in order to have a better chance in the Tower. Ultimately, however, boredom will set in and 
the PC will have to face the Tower. Obtaining the Fire Orb is a huge hurdle to get over and 
marks a division between the earlier, beginning parts of the game and the latter parts of 
the game. Some players also believe it marks the division between beginning and advanced 
players.

The Tower of Eternal Flames consists of four levels. They are all very, very hot. This 
causes damage to both the PC and his equipment, whether worn or in the pack. To protect the 
PC, fire resistance or immunity is necessary. See section 0.12.1 about fire resistance.

To protect the PC (other than drakelings, see below) completely from the heat in the ToEF, 
the PC must have four sources of fire resistance. Note that intrinsic fire resistance 
counts as two sources. Thus, for example, a PC with intrinsic fire resistance wearing a 
ring of fire resistance under the elemental gauntlets would take no damage from the heat in 
the Tower.

There are a number of artifacts that grant fire resistance or immunity. Two guaranteed 
examples are the elemental gauntlets (resistance) and the Crown of Science (immunity, but 
also dooms and curses). It is probably not worth wearing the Crown of Science unless the 
situation is desperate, since the bad luck it generates causes firproof blankets and rings 
of ice to fail much more often, in addition to the usual bad effects. There are several 
other nonguaranteed artifacts which grant resistance or immunity to fire. It is worth 
remembering that artifacts are indestructible and so cannot be damaged by the heat in the 
Tower.

Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF. The Mad Minstrel sings a song about this. 
Drakelings, even those with fire immunity, always take damage in the ToEF. This is not 
because of the heat itself but is a secondary effect due to the greatly increased 
metabolism drakelings will suffer from in the ToEF. There is no way around it. In order to 
survive, drakelings must have a means of regeneration or healing in the ToEF. Ideally an 
artifact that causes regeneration should be worn. An alternative is to bring blessed 
potions of extra healing along. It is possible for drakelings to do the ToEF with only 
three or four blessed PoEH if everything is done efficiently with no wasted time.

One technique drakelings (and other races for that matter) can use is to read a blessed 
scroll of magic mapping upon entering a new level of the ToEF followed by teleportation to 
the up stairway. Obviously the PC must have the necessary scrolls, wands or spell and 
teleport control.

The heat in the tower will destroy equipment that is vulnerable to fire. This includes most 
items that are not made of the higher metals mithril, adamantium and eternium. Artifacts 
are of course the exception.

If a PC must wear items vulnerable to fire, a blessed ring of ice is necessary. Uncursed 
rings of ice will not work, they must be blessed. Even with a blessed ring of ice, some 
equipment destruction may occur. Blessed rings of ice seem to protect to the 92-95% level. 
Even wearing two blessed rings of ice does not guarantee worn equipment will not be 
destroyed, although the protection seems to go up to 99+%. A ring of ice is of course not 
necessary if the PC wears only artifacts and items made of the higher metals. Missiles are 
an obvious problem. It is rare to find enough arrows made from higher metals to satisfy an 
archer in the ToEF, for instance. Even rocks are vulnerable to the heat, sometimes 
exploding. Non-artifact slings, bows and crossbows are liable to be burnt or melted. If the 
PC is not doomed or cursed, fireproof blankets (particularly blessed ones) are sufficient 
to protect the PC's pack. Fireproof blankets do not protect worn equipment, of course. If 
the PC is doomed or cursed, for instance from wearing the Crown of Science, which grants 
fire immunity, fireproof blankets seem to disintegrate much more readily.

This whole situation is very vexing, because the ToEF contains a very nasty collection of 
monsters and the PC naturally wants to bring his best equipment with him, but at the same 
time does not want it destroyed.

One thing to remember - rings are never destroyed until the gauntlets worn over them are 
destroyed. Since the artifact elemental gauntlets are available to all PCs, this provides a 
foolproof means of protecting nonartifact rings.

The objective in the ToEF is of course the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. It is held by the 
Ancient Chaos Wyrm who can be found on the top level of the ToEF. This level is typical of 
the levels containing elemental temples. The temple itself occupies half of the level and 
is disconnected. It can only be reached by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the 
level. Since a PC may have his only means of digging destroyed on his way through the 
tower, praying on the top level will result in a pickaxe gift from the PC's god.

The temple itself is occupied by problematic monsters. These include fire elementals, 
chaos servants, fire grues, fire drakes and fire demons in addition to the orb guardian. 
The fire demons and fire grues in particular are annoying because they have a corrupting 
melee attack with a very high to-hit. Even PCs with excellent DV will be hit eventually. 
Taken as a whole, this means that invisibility is very, very desirable in the Fire Temple.

2.19.1 The Ancient Chaos Wyrm

The Ancient Chaos Wyrm holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, the key to the lower parts 
of the CoC. It has a fire breath attack and a corrupting melee attack. In addition it is 
able to cast confusion and an energy ray. It is able to heal its wounds. The ACW can be 
killed in a variety of ways including brute force, although it is preferable to attack it 
from a distance due to its corrupting melee attack. The ACW is vulnerable to cold attacks 
(as are most of the monsters in the temple) and dragon slaying ammo. If it is killed on 
the temple's altar, be extraordinarily careful! If the PC is visible the fire demons will 
sacrifice him instantly. Even if the PC is invisible, fire demons who have been engaged 
in melee will "know" where the PC is and sacrifice him. The safest thing to do is kick 
anything dropped on the altar to an adjacent square before picking it up. The elemental 
altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for 
an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of 
Chaos.

An examination of the Ancient Chaos Wyrm with a blessed stethoscope reveals:

You examine the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 20, Hits: 209, 
Attacks: 3, Damage: 15-51. Speed: 98.


2.20 The Ruined City

The Ruined City is the entrance to the Minotaur Maze, found in the far western central 
part of the wilderness map.

Upon entering the wilderness square containing the ruined city, the following messages 
are generated:

"As you advance into the ruins, you catch a short sight on some strange huge figure...

With fluid motions it disappears into the ruins!

Something seems to be waiting for you...

You enter the ancient street of a long-dead and even longer-forgotten city.

Various trees and shrubs have overgrown the monuments of a former civilization. Strange 
unknown runes cover what remains of ancient palaces and buildings. Some forboding evil 
seems to lurk beneath the peace of death emanating from this strange place."

A map of the ruined city reveals the strange huge figure to be a minotaur mazelord 
guarding the entrance to the minotaur maze hidden behind a secret door:


..................==...................................#........................
..................==...................................#........................

...T..........T..........T........######........T.......T.....==....##..#.......
..............................................................==................
..............................................................==................
..............................................................==................

The minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance may or may not be hostile. This may be 
alignment dependent (he seems to be hostile to lawfuls), among other things and 
needs further investigation.

There is a lower experience level limit in order to enter the Minotaur Maze, which seems to 
be experience level 22. PCs with lower experience level are frightened away. Likewise, 
there is an upper limit, which seems to be experience level 30. The entrance to the 
Minotaur Maze is covered by an immovable stone block at this point. Given the extremely 
nasty nature of the Minotaur Maze, the player is well advised to have the PC as experienced 
as possible before entering.

The objective is to find the Minotaur Emperor on level seven of the maze. He holds the 
artifact Axe of the Minotaur Emperor.


2.20.1 The Minotaur Maze

The mazes are very challenging, with false doors, false staircases, living walls, and a 
variety of minotaurs, including minotaur mazemasters, mazelords, magi and kings. There is 
no random food generated in the mazes. The minotaurs leave corpses, but they are not good 
to eat because they cause confusion. Minotaurs may drop food when killed. The mazes are 
heavily trapped. The down staircases may lead to false levels, which must be explored only 
to find that there are two up staircases with no down staircase. Eventually the PC will 
find a true level six with a down staircase.

It is very obvious when the true bottom of the maze has been reached, because the following 
level message is generated:

"You feel that this maze level is special in some respect... its convoluted tunnels remind 
you of the brain tunnels of some sinister power lurking beneath the surface of the world 
and ready to strike at any intruders!"

A representative layout of the final level of the minotaur maze is shown here:

                              #####


2.20.1.1 The Minotaur Emperor

The Minotaur Emperor is the central 'M' in the above map, surrounded by minotaur mages 
which are able to cast confusion. When the Minotaur Emperor is killed, he drops several 
items which may vary. One example is:


    blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]     [1200s]
    uncursed potion of strength                                        [4s]
    uncursed potion of cure corruption                                 [2s]
    blessed potion of cure corruption                                  [2s]
    uncursed spellbook of Slow Monster                               [100s]
    uncursed minotaur emperor corpse                                 [240s]
    uncursed topaz                                                     [1s]


A blessed greater ID of the Axe of the Minotaur Emperor reveals:

---------- blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]---------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by -6 and PV by +4.
When used in melee combat it grants a +12 bonus to hit and causes 3d20+16
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -12 bonus to hit and
causes 3d16+6 points of damage.

It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee. 
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the weight of the artifact axe. The weight of the artifact, combined with the 
extraordinary difficulty of the mazes, makes most players completely ignore this location. 
It is in no way necessary to complete the game. This dungeon is one that may (hopefully?) 
be substantially revised in future versions of ADOM.


2.21 The High Mountain Village - part two


2.21.1 The Stone Giant Lord

Sometimes there is a Stone Giant Lord generated outside the High Mountain Village walls 
near where the PC enters from the wilderness. Needless to say, this can be a nasty surprise 
for a relatively low level PC who has descended through the Unremarkable Dungeon at the 
beginning of the game. If you can't run away, an attack with berserk tactics may work if 
the PC has a decent weapon. He is vulnerable to magic.


2.21.2 Hawkslayer

The burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village will join a PC and act as a companion 
providing certain criteria are met: the PC must not be chaotic and the player (*not* the PC) 
must know a secret password ("Iceberg"). The only way to learn the password in ADOM itself 
is drinking from pools, and many players are reluctant to do so. Some players may remember 
Hawkslayer from the computer RPG "Bard's Tale III". The password is the same in that game.  
There is also an experience level requirement which is uncertain.  Level 25 PC's have 
successfully gotten Hawkslayer as a companion, so that stands as a maximum level for the 
requirement at the moment.

Hawkslayer is not super-buff as companions go, but he is not bad.

On arriving at the HMV with a level 15 PC and using a blessed stethoscope on him, 
Hawkslayer was found to be:

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 15, 
Hits: 355, Attacks: 1, Damage: 14-50. Speed: 120.

A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup on September 14th, 2000 described a PC who was 
very careful with Hawkslayer to start, training him in the upper levels of the CoC, 
proceeding to the Big Room then deeper into the CoC until he was able to take on molochs 
and balors. Using a blessed stethoscope on him at that point gave the following:

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 110, DV: 96, PV: 36, 
Hits: 805, Attacks: 11, Damage: 50-86. Speed:120.

Quite impressive.

Hawkslayer uses arrows which can be retrieved for the PC's own use.


2.21.3 Ratling guardians

Two ratling guardians are found at the entrance to the city. They seem to be flavor 
elements more than anything else and play no real role in the plot of the game.


2.21.4 Leggot

Leggot is the shopkeeper in the High Mountain Village. He may offer better prices than 
Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper in Dwarftown, both when selling items and buying items. He does 
not share Waldenbrook's hatred of dark elves.


2.21.5 Ogre guardian

Like the ratling guardians, the ogre guardian plays no real part in the game. He guards a 
prison in the High Mountain Village which holds a few monsters. The ogre guardian does not 
react if the PC opens the jail and kills the monsters within.  If the ogre guardian becomes 
hostile, he is capable of throwing huge rocks at the PC.


2.21.6 Gaab'Baay

Gaab'Baay is of critical importance for those attempting a special ending. She assigns 
several quests; the reward is the Medal of Chaos, which is required to pass through the 
Chaos Gate. She will assign quests only to PCs with chaotic alignment. She will not assign 
quests until the demented ratling has been given six artifacts ("Talk to the mutated 
one."). Her quests are as follows: 1) Bring her the skull of a giant boar. An annoying 
quest. Giant boars can only be found randomly in the wilderness, and rarely leave skulls, 
even for PCs that have Food Preservation at 100. This quest can literally take months of 
game time to complete, causing elapsed game time to exceed the 90 day point at which time 
background corruption starts to accelerate. 2) Bring a potion of cure corruption. These can 
be obtained from Guth'Alak (see section 0.10.2.1.1). It is worth taking the time to get one 
from Guth'Alak, since they are very rare otherwise. 3) Bring the corpse of a farmer. Quite 
often a farmer will be wandering around the outside of the High Mountain Village. Otherwise 
they can be found in Terinyo. It is widely believed that farmers will never leave a corpse 
until this quest is assigned, and leave a corpse every time after this quest is assigned. 
So if you are playing a wild chaotic, use some restraint and don't wipe out all farmers 
just because they are easy to kill. It might also be prudent to kill off the stone giant 
lord outside the HMV if one is generated. You don't want him killing off your farmer. There 
has been a recent report (October 13th, 2000) concerning a farmer that did *not* leave a 
corpse after receiving this quest, so it may be a matter of strong probability rather than 
certainity. 4) Bring a scroll of danger. Another scarce item. If the PC finds one, it 
should be put somewhere safe until it is needed. 5) Bring a wand of monster creation. Note 
that a cursed wand of monster creation will work, but one with zero charges left will not. 
After successfully delivering all of these items, Gaab'Baay produces the Medal of Chaos. 
Note that it, like all parts of the Chaos Trinity, corrupts the PC merely by carrying it. 
Leave it somewhere safe until it is needed.


2.21.7 The Oracle

The Oracle dispenses advice to PCs with all three parts of the Chaos Trinity about 
how to become a chaos god. However, it is no longer necessary to have all three 
parts of the Chaos Trinity to enter the Chaos Gate. Interaction with the Oracle in 
ADOM 1.0.0 has not been thoroughly investigated.

The corpse of the Oracle grants +6 to Learning but also curses and dooms the PC.
Beware of attacking the Oracle.  She is capable of casting Death Ray and shares the 
properties of karmic beings, although she is not named as such.


2.21.8 The malicious doctor

The malicious doctor has a flesh golem companion for sale for 25,000 gold pieces. He plays 
no other part in the game. From the reports of those who have acquired this companion, it 
is not worth the money. If the player wants this companion, it is worth luring the malicious 
doctor to the SMC before buying it. In that case it is generated with much more experience.

Note that the malicious doctor will not sell this companion to lawful PCs.  When lawful 
PCs 'C'hat with him, the game responds with "The malicious doctor eyes you with 
suspicion.  "My office is closed." "


2.21.9 Ratling traders

Ratling traders are occasionally generated in the High Mountain Village. Like many other 
random monsters in the High Mountain Village, they are quite often hostile. If the PC needs 
food at this point, don't kill hostile ratling traders. They may eventually become 
nonhostile and therefore a source of food.


2.21.10 Hidden locations

There are three hidden locations in the High Mountain Village.  Gaab'Baay is located in 
a hidden passageway along the eastern wall.  Two scrolls are located in the doorless 
room in the center of the northern wall.  The only way to enter this room is with 
teleportation.  Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to 
and within the room:

  #######
  .#.?.#.
  .#^..#.
  .#####.
  ^......

The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created.  A teleportation 
trap can also be created on the square where the scrolls lie, of course.

The two scrolls are a cursed scroll of chaos resistance and a "strange 
message".  See section 5.2 for the contents.  The final location is a hidden passage in 
the western wall.  It contains a potion of ultra healing and a staircase behind yet 
another hidden door.  The staircase leads to the northern central part of the wilderness.


2.22 The Rift

The Rift is a wilderness location found in the northwestern mountains, southeast of the 
dungeon containing the Tomb of the High Kings.  The PC must meet several requirements in 
order to enter it.  A climbing set is required (although ADOM 1.0.0 and g16p2, at least, 
have a bug which causes this to be ignored) and the Climbing skill must be at 100.  The PC 
must be at least experience level 18.  If the experience level requirement is not met, the 
game responds with: "You do not feel experienced enough for this daunting task."  Willpower 
must be at least 20 OR Perception must be less than six. 

If all these requirements are met, the PC will still most likely fall on the way down the 
Rift, destroying some equipment in the process. Falling can be avoided by having the 
extremely thin and nimble AND the very light corruptions. This needs further testing. It 
may be that only the very light corruption is required, as per the fortune cookie message 
"Being light as a feather makes you very rifty." Alternatively, it may be that only 
hurthlings can avoid falling with only one of these corruptions, similar to the entrance 
requirements for the Quickling Tree. There are reportedly 27 luck checks on the way down, 
whatever that actually means. Being burdened or strained is probably not a good idea. A 
level 50 PC, not cursed or doomed, with intrinsic Lucky and Fate Smiles, wearing the ankh 
and the Ring of the Master Cat, unburdened, but without the requisite corruptions, still 
fell. It is not possible to bring artifacts only into the Rift, since a climbing set (and 
probably food, although enough *might* be found) is required. Therefore, it is a good idea 
to store the PC's extremely valuable items, such as scrolls of chaos resistance, in a safe 
place before entering the Rift. It is also a good idea to bring every bit of junk, such as 
missiles that do not stack, low quality armor and weapons, scrolls of ill fate, cure 
blindness and the like, low quality amulets, etc. along. These items are fodder for the 
RNG, which hopefully will destroy them rather than valuable equipment. Do not be too 
conservative and leave *all* good equipment behind, because the monsters in the Rift 
dungeon and especially the Sinister Library of Niltrias can be *very* nasty. Hopefully by 
this point, the PC has some decent artifact armor and weapons. A corollary is not to rush 
into the Rift too soon.

It is not necessary to visit the Rift dungeon or the Sinister Library of Niltrias to 
complete the game, and many who play non-spellcasters completely ignore it.

The whole point of entering the Rift is to gain access to the Sinister Library of Niltrias 
- see below.


2.22.1 The Rift dungeon

After the PC climbs (falls) down the Rift, he arrives in the Rift dungeon on RL3. The 
dungeon consists of nine levels, which are numbered in the opposite sense compared to every 
other dungeon in the game (the Tower of Eternal Flames is an exception) - RL1 is the 
bottom, while RL9 is the top. This dungeon features dangerous monsters - greater chaos 
servants, chaos mutants, elementals, greater elementals and higher level quicklings are not 
uncommon. Two up staircases will be found on RL5 or RL6. One leads to the higher Rift 
dungeon level, the other leads into the wilderness in a pass inside the unclimbable 
mountains. A short journey, which again requires a climbing set, leads to the entrance to 
the Sinister Library of Niltrias.


2.22.1.1 The ratling dealer

If the PC was unlucky enough to have his climbing set destroyed during the descent through 
the Rift, another is available from a unique ratling dealer on the bottom level of the Rift 
dungeon. This NPC is nonhostile in an otherwise rather hostile environment. As a 
consequence, it is quite possible for him to be killed by other monsters. If the PC needs a 
climbing set from him, find him quickly and be prepared to pay 50,000 gold pieces for it.


2.22.2 The Sinister Library of Niltrias

The layout of the Library is as follows:


         #########################################        #######
         #..............................##......"#      ###.....###
         #..............................##.##....#     ##...#.#...##

   #.."##"......"##"......"##"............##"."####.#   ##.......##
   #]...1...##".......##"......"##"."##"............#    #########
   ##################################################

The numeral 1 represents secret doors.

The ghost librarian 'G' is nonhostile (see the section below).

There is a certain amount of variation in the items found in the Library; this map was 
generated with a wizard PC. The items in the eastern chamber and the large main room will 
be scrolls rather than spellbooks for non-spellcasters. This is a good thing, since scrolls 
are useful for all classes, while non-spellcasters are often unable to read spellbooks 
efficiently or at all. Note the ] in the southwest corner. It is a climbing set, which is 
required to get back into the Rift dungeon. Equipment may be destroyed while in the 
Library, so it is prudent to leave the climbing set where it is until the PC is finished 
with the rest of the Library. There will be monster guardians found on top of every 
spellbook or scroll. These monsters can be anything and are uniformly dangerous. On a 
recent trip through the Library, a master lich, ancient dragons, a quickling lord, a frost 
giant jarl, a stone giant lord, a moloch and a mimic hivemind were found among others. It 
is wise to bring dragon slaying ammo in case an ancient karmic dragon is generated. 
Likewise, demon slaying ammo or phase daggers are very nice to have in case a (greater) 
moloch is generated.

Wizards who visit the Library will find every spellbook available in the game, including 
Wish. Necromancers, for instance, will not. Necromancers find scrolls in the two large 
rooms and spellbooks in the small northeast room and the hidden passageway. The exact 
details of what class finds Spellbooks vs scrolls is being investigated. Spellbooks can be 
destroyed while in the Library (by blue dragons, for example), so be careful with rare 
spellbooks.


2.22.2.1 The Ghost Librarian

The Ghost Librarian is nonhostile and plays no role in the game under most circumstances. 
However, he can be the source of an important artifact, the Weird Tome. In order to obtain 
the Weird Tome the PC must have Stealth at 100 and spend at least 2000 turns in the Library 
without 'C'hatting to monsters. Currently, wizards, for instance, can cast spells 
throughout their combat in the Library and, after vanquishing the monsters, read some 
spellbooks to pass time before 'C'hatting to the Ghost Librarian. At that point the Ghost 
Librarian will reward the PC with the Weird Tome, which can be exchanged for five cursed 
scrolls of chaos resistance courtesy of the Mad Minstrel. It is impossible to read the 
weird tome. The message generated is: "This book is filled with strange texts written in 
weird letters. You have difficulties concentrating on the text. After a while you manage to 
focus your sight on the text. The text contains a strange collection of tunes, songs and 
instrumental pieces. It seems to be some kind of code, hinting at some ancient powerful 
magic, a scroll or something like that... You fail to decipher it." High level wizards, for 
instance, who attempt to read the Weird Tome are Confused for a considerable length of time. 
Do not try it in a potentially dangerous location!


2.23 The Stone Circle

The Stone Circle is located in the northwest part of the wilderness map. It can only be 
entered by PCs who have satisfied the demented ratling (section 2.5.8). Furthermore, it can 
only be entered during the night of Darknight. Determining exactly when it is available is 
not an exact science. In practice, the PC stands on the circle as soon as it is Darknight 
and repeatedly presses > until eventually he enters.

The Stone Circle is located on a plain. There is an entrance tunnel guarded by two dwarven 
chaos knights who should not be a problem for a PC at this level. The doorway into the 
circle is guarded by two annihilators, who can annoyingly destroy the PC's equipment. 
Ideally the PC should be invisible and destroy them from a distance. The alternative should 
be to hit them as hard as possible with the best melee attack available.

There is a unique pool inside the Stone Circle.  Drinking from it results in the 
message "You feel altered in an eerie way."  It always causes ~2 corruptions.


2.23.1 Keriax

The circle itself contains Keriax, the multi-headed chaos dragon in the center with eight 
writhing masses of primal chaos scattered about the walls of the room. It is important to 
dispatch Keriax quickly, as he has a variety of very nasty attacks. He is able to breathe 
bolts including corrupting bolts, confuses the PC and drains stats if engaged in melee. He 
is vulnerable to the Acid Ball spell and dragon slaying ammo. Potions of blindness work on 
him. Killing him from a distance is highly recommended. His corpse grants large increases 
to Strength, Toughness, Mana and Perception, but also causes *massive* corruption - about 
8 corruptions. If he is killed late in the game and a PC needs corruptions for an Avatar 
of Balance or Ultimate Chaos God ending, this is one way to get them quickly.

The objective here is the Crown of Chaos, which Keriax holds. As with all parts of the 
Chaos Trinity, it corrupts the PC merely by carrying it. Put it someplace safe until it is 
needed.


2.24 The Quickling Tree

The Quickling Tree can be found in any portion of the forested wilderness west of the 
river.  This means that a PC should 's'earch for it in a convenient place, such as next 
to the Mad Minstrel's clearing.  It can be found at any time, but to actually enter it 
usually requires two corruptions: the extrememly thin and nimble and the very light 
corruptions. This is because the PC must weigh no more than ten kilos to enter the tree. 
Hurthlings are often an exception: they can enter the quickling tree with only the thin 
and nimble corruption (which is required under any circumstances).  Also, the weight of 
the PCs inventory is limited to 160 stones.  This means eternium plate mails, crowns of 
leadership and the like are not going to be useful.  In fact it is worth picking up any 
light armor the PC finds throughout the game and identifying all of it at some point in 
case any of it is useful in the quickling tree.

Quicklings use hand crossbows and dark elven quarrels as missile weapons and drop them as 
they are killed. Some prior experience with crossbows is therefore useful. Quicklings fall 
fairly easily in melee, with missile weapons or using magic. They are just very, very fast.

The whole point of entering the quickling tree is to eat the corpses of the quicklings as 
they are killed, which provides speed bonuses. There are plenty of corpses generated for a 
PC with a good Food Preservation skill, so an amulet of hunger or stomacemptia herbs are 
useful in the tree. As would be expected, the higher level quickling corpses give better 
speed bonuses, so the quickling lord corpses should be eaten first. The tree contains a 
quickling king and quickling queen, whose corpses provide the best speed bonuses if they 
are generated, but they also shorten the PC's life span. This is where those potions of 
longevity come in handy for races with relatively short life spans.

The quickling queen stands on a pair of artifact boots, the Boots of Great Speed, greater 
identified as follows:

---------------- boots of great speed [+5, +0] (+30 spd)--------------

When worn it modifies DV by +5 and PV by +0.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 
1d3 points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus 
to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.

It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It modifies your speed by +30.
It grants bad luck.
Wearing it makes you doomed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If it is desired, the PC may tunnel directly south from the entrance room into the room 
containing the high level quicklings.

Time passes very quickly in the quickling tree. It is not unusual to enter on day 70 and 
find that it is day 140 upon emerging. This means the 90 day limit has passed and 
background corruption will become faster. Ideally a PC will do the quickling tree right 
before the final dive to the lowest levels of the CoC.


2.25 The Infinite Dungeon

The Infinite Dungeon is found in the southeastern part of the wilderness map. Prior to 
entering it, the description is "A tiny, strangely distorted cave entry."

The Infinite Dungeon (ID) is truly infinite for all practical purposes. The level number is 
limited by some 32 or 64 bit integer value, but who really cares about that? It would take 
many lifetimes to descend through all its levels, even assuming a PC could survive such a 
trip, which is impossible. The danger level increases with dungeon level; any level greater 
than 200 or so becomes ridiculous.

The ID has some unique characteristics: shops, altars and pools are never generated. Every 
dungeon level is randomly generated, so leaving a level and reentering it results in a 
completely new dungeon level. There is one special level, the SIL, where MaLaKaI resides.

According to the Mad Minstrel, the ID was originally a monument built by the powers of law. 
The incursion of Chaos into Ancardia has twisted it into its current condition.


2.25.1 Filk

Filk is found in the ID on the level corresponding to the number of first-killed monsters 
killed. For example if the first monster killed was a rat and 225 rats have been killed, 
Filk will be found on I: 225. Filk is a quickling bard and the fastest quickling in the 
game with a speed of 1500. His DV/PV is 500/0. He shares the properties of karmics although 
he is not named as such. More about obtaining the Filk quest is found in section 4.3.1.1.


2.25.2 MaLaKaI

MaLaKaI resides in the SIL, found at about level 66 of the ID. He is a chaos knight and 
guards the Sceptre of Chaos. The SIL is not really part of the ID. It is discovered by 
descending through the ID normally, but once left, it can never be found again. This means 
if a PC needs the Sceptre of Chaos, there is only one chance to get it, so be prepared. 
MaLaKaI is quite tough. He is designed to be an opponent for characters above level 40. He 
has a corrupting melee attack.

Conclusive proof that the SIL is not part of the ID is the fact that altars are sometimes 
generated in the SIL. These can come in very handy since MaLaKaI can be sacrificed.


2.26 The Unicorn Quests

Guth'Alak, the druid in Terinyo, will reveal the location of the Greater White Unicorn's 
glade once the PC reaches experience level 30, regardless of the PC's alignment. He asks 
the PC to search a beautiful park in the central forest for a good and noble creature in 
need of help. Upon returning to the central forest, the glade appears as a green asterisk 
near the Old Barbarian's clearing. It is described as "A beautiful park." prior to 
entering.

2.26.1 Yrruir, the Greater White Unicorn

After entering the glade, Yrruir can be found teleporting around randomly. Despite the fact 
that Guth'Alak reveals this location regardless of alignment, Yrruir generally attacks PCs 
with chaotic alignment on sight. There have been rare and scattered reports of chaotic PCs 
who were not attacked. When 'C'hatted with, Yrruir explains that the forces of Chaos have 
stolen a part of his life essence and forged it into his evil counterpart, manifested as a 
Greater Black Unicorn. Yrruir asks the PC to kill his counterpart in order to regain the 
stolen life essence and restore his full powers. If the PC is successful, Yrruir rewards 
the PC with an offer to cleanse all corruption *once* and only once. A player who completes 
this quest has to carefully decide when to take advantage of Yrruir's offer. If the PC is 
badly corrupted prior to entering the lowest parts of the CoC, it will probably be 
necessary to have all corruption removed before the endgame. However, it is best to have 
Yrruir remove all corruption as the last thing the PC does before leaving the Drakalor 
Chain, if the player is concerned with receiving the highest possible score and happiest 
future history after finishing.

2.26.2 Riurry, the Greater Black Unicorn

Riurry can be found in a corrupted glade just east of Yrruir's glade. As an evil chaotic 
being, he of course offers rewards if the PC kills Yrruir when 'C'hatted with. If the PC 
then returns to Yrruir, he is warned not to listen to Riurry's evil babbling. Killing 
Yrruir at this point will result in a significant alignment drop, of course, but causes no 
other noticeable effects. The PC does not lose the Lucky or Fate Smiles intrinsics, nor 
does he gain the Cursed or Doomed intrinsics. Returning to Riurry and 'C'hatting results in 
being rewarded with 1-2 corruptions, a blessed amulet of chaos and 5-7 uncursed potions of 
gain attributes. The player has to decide which path to take. The potions of gain 
attributes are a significant reward. If the player is going for an ultimate chaos god 
ending, it seems logical to accept Riurry's quest. Other PCs may choose this quest if 
corruption is either not a problem or desired for chaos gate entry. The alignment drop may 
also be useful for becoming chaotic around experience level 30 in order to receive 
Gaab'Baay's quests, for those PCs attempting an ultra ending.


2.27 The Bug-Infested Temple

100 PC deaths must be recorded in the adom.cnt file before entry will be allowed.  
There are no experience or level requirements for entry, either for the PC or 
in the HISCORE file.

Some of the walls in the bug temple are diggable, but so many are not that it is not 
possible to make real progress.

The bug temple has been beefed up considerably with the simple addition of the 
see invisible intrinsic for the bugs. Low (or even high) level spellcasters are 
no longer going to be able to finish this area easily.

The rewards have been toned down: only three SoCRs, six PoUH, eight SoMM. The 
wand of fireballs has ten charges, the wand of teleportation has six charges. 

The bug-infested temple consists of two parts: the bug wilderness (BUGWIL) and bug cave 
(BUGCAV). The wilderness part's outer limits are scattered with greater claw bugs, that 
low-level spellcasters can bolt to death (be very cautious!). Around the down staircase, 
there are eight killer bugs.

Note that both greater claw bugs and killer bugs have high speed, breed, have multiple 
attacks and bypass the PC's PV. This means that they are what they're called - killers - 
in melee.

Eating a greater claw bug corpse increases speed, gives +3 Dx and -6 Wi. Eating a killer 
bug corpse also increases speed, gives +6 Dx and -12 Wi.

The layout of BUGCAV:


   ##########################                            ############

The 'g's are greater claw bugs and 'i's are killer bugs. ]'s represent named marble statues. 
The numeral 1 represents secret doors. Teleportation doesn't work in BUGCAV.  All the 
marble statues can be picked up and broken, like normal ones. However, there's another 
meaning to them; reading. They're in place to honor the prerelease testing group of version 
1.0.0. Here's a compilation of what they all mean and what you get from them. The format for 
the list is: real name of tester - statue text - reward for breaking the statue, besides 
rocks

Thomas Biskup - "Bassuk Thimosp, Human wizard, who slaughtered the fearful experience 
                 drainer of Prr'rlse." - nothing

Stephen Mackey (Karkadinn) - "Matsep Cheyken, Troll Assassin, who dedicated his life to 
                              harvesting the fish of Vinooresen." - barbed trident of 
                              hunting (+2, 3d5+5)

Markku Rikola - "Molkar Ur-Yack, the Orcish Elementalist, who unraveled the secret of the 
                 legendary Ball of Hellfire, unfortunately slaughtering himself in the 
                 process." - wand of fireballs (10 charges)

Olli "Shader" Juhala - "Da Sehr Jhuala Liol, Dark Elven Beastfighter. He was unexepctedly 
                        engulfed by the primal chaos of sorcerer coined." - 3 * scroll of 
                        chaos resistance

Adrian Bancilhon - "Raidan Nichloban, Gray Elven Barbarian. Slow of tongue, Slow of speech, 
                    The healing arts, He helped to teach." - 6 * potion of ultra healing

Andy Williams - "Malawi Syldin, Dark Elven Ranger, who opened the lost door of Mixyip Tor." 
                 - wand of door creation (100 charges)

John Rowat - "Wor Janoth, Hurthling Mindcrafter. Explorer of the Lost Volcano." - 8 * 
              scroll of magic mapping

Julian Day - "Yali Na Jud, Dark Elven Merchant, who collected the orbs before being crushed 
              by a thousand tons of rock." - padded elven chain mail of resilience [+0, +9]

Paul Nimmo - "Apul Omnim, the Male Human paladin. Finder of the sightless path." - vigilant 
              adamantion plate mail of travelling (-2, -4) [-2, +11]

Teemu Kokki - "Tuok Mekkei, Dwarven Ranger, who took part in the expedition where the 
               mysterious experience drainer was first discovered." - 12 * winged quarrel 
               of slaying

Olivier Benard - "Dervi Albeiron, Human Paladin. He joined the forces of Law against the 
                 foul beasts of G'ubs." - lawful 2HS of devastation (+3, 5d10+8) [-1, +0]

Aaron Dutton - "Anora Tnod't, Troll Paladine. Lurker who was last to observe a dungeon 
                collapse caused by a writhing mass of primal chaos." - holy heavy club of 
                devastation (+3, 5d10+8) [-1, +0]

Conrad Brekke - "Candor Kerbek the Trap Eater. Dark Elf Assassin. Who devised the devious 
                 deathmaze of the Assassin's Guild." - wand of teleportation (6 charges)

Joni Toivanen - "Janoi Netovi, the Human Barbarian, who was seriously ill while others 
                 slaughtered gubs." - 12 * crystal of health

Note that some of the rewards' stats may vary and that they are all *cursed*. However, those 
potions of ultra healing, scrolls of magic mapping and especially the scrolls of chaos 
resistance are a gift that makes visiting the Bug Cave very worthwhile.

There is one more statue, an "unfinished statue of an unquestionably famous hero" in honor 
of Raymond Martineau. No reward for breaking him down, though.

Breaking all the statues stops the breeding of the bugs and results in an appropriate line 
in the accomplishment list at the end of the game.

3.                        LATE GAME STRATEGIES


3.1 The wall of flames

A wall of flames is encountered around D: 27. Even if the PC has fire immunity, it cannot 
be passed without the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. The Orb is found in the Tower of Eternal 
Flames. The wall of flames forces the player to retrieve it before proceeding. See section 
2.19 for more on the Tower of Eternal Flames.


3.2 The Eternal Guardian

The Eternal Guardian is found one or two levels before the Casino. He guards the down 
staircase on the level. He only allows peaceful passage of PCs if they are wearing the Ring 
of the High Kings, obtainable from the Tomb of the High Kings (section 2.12). It is 
definitely possible to pass him without the ring, although it presents special problems. 
The obvious tactic of teleporting him away from the stairs does not work, as he is 
resistant to teleportation. Trying to kill him in melee or with missiles is more or less 
pointless, since he reincarnates even if the PC manages to kill him, which is very 
difficult. If a PC wants to pass him without the RotHK, it is best to make him angry such 
that he chases the PC, followed by a quick teleport to the down stairs and descent.

Note, however, that passing the Eternal Guardian without the Ring of the High Kings means 
that the shortcut to the surface through Darkforge (see section 3.4) will not work in the 
down direction - a distinct disadvantage.


3.3 The Casino

The Casino is found on D: 30 or D: 31. The layout is as follows:

The guaranteed monsters found here are casino guards (the @s outside the Great Gift 
Shoppe), a big casino guard (guarding the down staircase) and the shopkeeper (the @ 
inside the Great Gift Shoppe). The $s in the body of the Casino are not piles of gold, 
but rather slot machines. There will be a number of non-hostile monsters wandering 
about the Casino and the Great Gift Shoppe.

It is possible to win essentialy unlimited amounts of gold from the slot machines. 
Intrinsic Dooming, Cursing, Lucky and Fate Smiles have no effect. Wearing items that 
grant Luck (the hidden property) or the Lucky/Fate Smiles intrinsics make no difference. 
The fastest way to accumulate money is to choose a machine that costs 24 gold pieces to 
play and 'h'andle the lever. Place a heavy object on the spacebar of your keyboard. 
Check back after five minutes or so by picking up the gold on the floor. There should be 
quite a pile.

As long as the technique above is used - simply leaving the spacebar depressed - all of 
this gambling will take place during a single game turn, so the PC will not be spending 
hours of game time in the Casino getting corrupted. This is after all D: 30 or D: 31, 
moderately deep in the CoC. So resist the temptation to check on your winnings every 30 
seconds! ;-)

The payout from the slot machines follows a precise formula, shown below: 

Item               Two alike        Three alike
----               ---------        -----------

kobold                  1x                 1x
goblin                  4x                 8x
hobgoblin               9x                27x
gnoll                  16x                64x
ogre                   25x               125x
wizard                 36x               216x 
ettin                  49x               343x
giant                  64x               512x
hero                   81x               729x
treasure hoard        100x              1000x
magical wand          121x              1331x
magical ring          144x              1728x
magical weapon        169x              2197x
magical armor         196x              2744x
artifact              225x              3375x
ancient hero          256x              4096x
dragon                289x              4913x
ancient dragon        324x              5832x

As an example, two goblins results in a return of 4x the original bet, for a profit of 3x 
the original bet.  The average payout works out to approximately 24x the original bet.  
This has been verified empirically, and agrees with theory.

Be aware that if the PC uses the slot machines, the Big Casino Guard will block the down 
staircase and expect the PC to spend his winnings - and more - in the Great Gift Shoppe, 
which is ridiculously overpriced. This problem can be solved by teleporting the Big Casino 
Guard. This transports him to another location on the level. He does not become hostile, 
does not move and behaves exactly as if he were still blocking the stairs (this is probably 
a bug).


3.3.1 Strategies for robbing the Casino

There are two monsters that are particularly tough on the level: the shopkeeper and the big 
casino guard. Their vital statistics:

Big casino guard: You examine the big casino guard. Diagnosis: Level: 2, 
DV: 19, PV: 24, Hits: 307, Attacks: 2, Damage: 17-72. Speed: 106.

Shopkeeper: You examine Orgovek, the human shopkeeper. Diagnosis: Level: 11, 
DV: 10, PV: 20, Hits: 926, Attacks: 6, Damage: 21-36. Speed: 195.

These stats do not change after the monsters become hostile.

The key event in robbing the Casino is causing the monsters on the level to become hostile, 
whether or not the PC has actually picked up anything from the Great Gift Shoppe. There are 
a number of events that will cause the monsters to become hostile, including attacking the 
guards or the shopkeeper and zapping a wand of destruction that damages any of the guards 
or the walls of the Great Gift Shoppe. Once the monsters become hostile, a number of things 
happen. First, the number of guards on the level approximately triples. They cluster around 
both the up and down staircases and are plentiful elsewhere. Second, the teleportation 
restrictions inside the Great Gift Shoppe cease. This means the PC is free to teleport to 
any location on the level, but since the up and down staircases will be blocked by guards, 
it is not possible to teleport to these locations and leave the level.

Invisibility is strange on the level. The casino guards and the big casino guard see 
invisible. The shopkeeper welcomes an invisible PC when he enters the Great Gift Shoppe, 
but when an invisible PC picks up an item, the shopkeeper does not immediately block the 
door. The standard "shopkeeper stares at your position with great intensity" message must 
be generated before he blocks the door. However, the shopkeeper instantly sounds an alarm 
when an undetected invisible PC who has picked up an item leaves the Great Gift Shoppe. 
Despite this, the shopkeeper does not see the invisible PC as he flees through the body of 
the Casino.

None of the monsters on the level are able to see in darkness. However, some will still 
cluster around the PC in darkness, while others, including the big casino guard who 
ordinarily blocks the down staircase, will wander aimlessly. This means that if a PC needs 
to rest and recover hitpoints, or pray for healing, or drink healing potions, darkness is 
your friend. A PC can stand in one spot indefinitely in the dark. The tendency of the 
monsters to cluster around the PC or wander about also means they will leave the vicinity 
of the staircases. Thus a PC can rob the Casino, cast Darkness, wait, then teleport to the 
down staircase. This is risky, however, since if the PC is doomed by robbing the Casino 
(see below) there is a 1 in 1000 chance of an instadeath each turn from a grue attack (see 
section 0.13.4).

The stats for the shopkeeper above should make it clear that speed is critical when robbing 
the Casino. Anything that increases speed is valuable - rings of speed, speed boosting 
potions and especially seven league boots. It is possible to make the shopkeeper hostile by 
throwing missiles or zapping a spell at him, ideally from as far away as possible, then 
literally outrun him out of the Great Gift Shoppe. This is one way the Casino can be robbed 
without any spells whatsoever.


3.3.2 Consequences of robbing the Casino

The consequences of robbing the Casino vary according to a couple of factors. First is the 
alignment of the PC. Lawful PCs will likely be cursed and doomed. Neutral PCs will likely 
be cursed, perhaps doomed. Chaotics will probably get away with no cursing or dooming. 
Lawful and neutral PCs will move their alignment towards chaotic. This may or may not be 
visible on the main screen. It is known for PCs to be so lawful by this point in the game 
that their alignment does not vary from L+ despite robbing the Casino. The second factor is 
exactly what transpires during the robbery. Killing the shopkeeper in the process of 
robbing the Casino is not recommended for crowned champions of Law or Balance, of course. 
Attacking the guards on the way out or after dragging them down to the next level should 
not cause an alignment drop as they will be hostile at that point.

The cursing and/or dooming is obviously the biggest problem PCs face after robbing the 
Casino. Fortunately, there is a shortcut to the surface of the Drakalor Chain (see section 
3.5) available one or two levels below the Casino. This makes it possible to get to a 
coaligned altar near the surface quickly and sacrifice in order to get rid of the unwanted 
cursing or dooming, although it is possible at this point in the game that the player might 
want to exploit those intrinsics. In any case, remember where those coaligned altars are 
near the surface! If you plan to rob the Casino, they can be essential.


3.4 The shortcut to the surface

A shortcut to the surface from deep in the CoC will be found at about D: 32. This is very 
handy for those who need access to the surface to complete quests for ultra endings, visit 
the quickling tree, do the Unicorn quests, etc. It is generally found two dungeon levels 
below the Casino. It is obvious because there will be two up staircases on the level. The 
shortcut causes the PC to emerge in Darkforge. The fact that it is close to the Casino is 
handy if the PC needs access to an aligned altar to remove dooming and/or cursing caused 
by robbing the Casino.

If the Eternal Guardian was passed peacefully by wearing the Ring of the High Kings, this 
shortcut works in both directions. If the Eternal Guardian was *not* passed peacefully, 
the shortcut works in the up direction only. This is a powerful argument for retrieving the 
RotHK and *not* attempting to pass the EG by trickery or combat.


3.5 Battle bunnies

This level is found on D: 33 or D: 34. You will know when you find it, because the level 
message "You suddenly sense an intense tension." is generated. It consists of a long 
northern corridor connected to a long southern corridor. Traversing these corridors allows 
time for the inhabitants of the level, battle bunnies, to breed. This is to be avoided as 
they breed like, well, rabbits. It can quickly get out of control. The best way to deal 
with the level is to immediately tunnel (or teleport) south by any means at the PC's 
disposal and kill Bugs, the leader of the level. This drastically reduces or eliminates 
further breeding of the bunnies. Kill the remainder and descend. Note that scrolls of 
vermin control do not work on the level, instead exploding to produce a green cloud of 
foul smoke.


3.6 The Cat Lord

The Cat Lord is found on D: 35 or D: 36. The level message "This level somehow seems to be 
removed from the rest of the world." is generated upon entering the level.  Note that 
teleportation is not allowed on the level and ceiling traps may therefore be generated. If 
the PC has killed no cats, the PC may 'C'hat with the Cat Lord, in which case the following 
message is generated: "The cat lord growls: "Thou hast respected the cat race. Thus I shall 
grant upon you this gift." The cat lord suddenly is gone. Nothing but a tiny ring is left 
of him." In this case, congratulations are due. The PC has the most powerful ring in the 
game, the artifact Ring of the Master Cat. It is enormously helpful in the end game, 
particularly because it grants +16 to Dexterity when the PC's dexterity is being destroyed 
by corruption. The ring's full properties are listed below:


-------------- ring of the master cat [+0,+5] {Dx+16} (+16 spd) ------------------

When worn it modifies DV by +0 and PV by +5.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +16.
It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee. It modifies your speed by +16.
It makes Fate smile upon you.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the PC has killed cats, the Cat Lord will be hostile. His power is dependent on the 
number of cats killed, becoming greater each time a cat is killed.


3.7 The Air Temple

The Air Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 38-42, below the Casino. The layout, on 
the left side of the level, is as follows:


       ##################                  ###########   #####################

       ##################                      #########


The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the traps. The 
numeral 1 is used to indicate secret doors. Note the underscore in the center of the 
temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least 
until he is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. The air demons 
(or Yulgash himself) will sacrifice the PC instantly should he step on it. The elemental 
altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for 
an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of 
Chaos. The monsters in the Air Temple are arrayed as follows:


       ##################                  ###########   #####################

They are: r - vapor rats
          x - air grues
          & - air demons
          C - chaos servants
          E - air elementals
          @ - (in the center) Yulgash, the Master Summoner

The Air Temple level features intermittent electrical discharges which will destroy both 
worn items and those in the pack, as well as damaging PCs without good shock resistance 
or immunity. It is highly advisable to leave precious non-artifact items on the level 
above or below the Air Temple. To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the 
monsters. The presence of the secret doors is actually helpful, since ideally the PC can 
take on the monsters outside of the temple first, without alerting the air elementals and 
grues. Yulgash will often teleport out of the Temple, however. The air elementals are 
very tough with many hitpoints and the ability to breathe lightning bolts, which can 
destroy the PC's equipment. The grues and demons are troublesome because they have a 
corrupting melee attack that has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be 
hit by them eventually - a good reason to develop the PCs missile weapon skills.  
Invisibility is tremendously useful. Only the chaos servants and Yulgash see invisible.


3.7.1 Yulgash, the Master Summoner

As befits his name, Yulgash is liable to summon anything up to and including great wyrms 
and ancient karmic dragons. Killing him as soon as he is aware of the PCs presence is 
therefore a top priority. Yulgash teleports, has a corrupting melee atack and is a 
spellcaster.

Yulgash holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Air, greater identified as follows:

------------------ uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10}-----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +10.

(air elemental pet + corruption when 'U'sed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.8 The Earth Temple

The Earth Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 42-46. The layout, on the right side 
of the level, is as follows:


   #########           #############       ##########################

       #.......................#          ##....##............##....##
       #########################           ##########################


The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Some of the walls in 
the Earth Temple are undiggable, but there is a way into every room by digging - it may 
take some experimentation to find it. Note the traps. The numeral 1 is used to indicate 
secret doors. Note the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic 
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and 
moves). The standard warning about standing on altars applies - the stone grues (and 
possibly other monsters) found on this level are capable of speech and will sacrifice the 
PC. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which 
means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before 
retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Earth Temple are arrayed as follows:

They are: s - stone snakes
          x - stone grues
          Y - stone golems
          C - chaos servants
          E - earth elementals
          F - (in the center) the Ancient Stone Beast

To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters. All of the monsters 
here with the exception of stone golems and chaos servants are able to travel through 
stone, so in practice the PC will probably be attacked before penetrating the walls of the 
temple. Stone snakes are poisonous, stone grues have a corrupting melee attack and earth 
elementals throw rocks, apparently using slings which are often left behind when they are 
killed. Earth elementals have many hitpoints and regenerate. Exact statistics for earth 
elementals and stone grues are not available from a blessed stethoscope - the game responds 
that the monster "rather seems to be a piece of furniture." The monster memory states that 
earth elementals have about 210 hitpoints, stone grues about 240 hitpoints. They both have 
a PV of 40, so use a powerful melee attack or they will take forever to kill. All of these 
monsters will fall to brute force or magic.


3.8.1 The Ancient Stone Beast

Attacking the Ancient Stone Beast may seem like attacking a wall of granite. It has over 
1000 hitpoints:

You examine the Ancient Stone Beast. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 10, PV: 60, Hits: 1091, Attacks: 1, Damage: 15-60. Speed: 91.

Not fast, not overwhelming PV, but it can take a formidable amount of bashing to bring down 
this creature. Not helping matters is the fact that it regenerates wounds and has a 
corrupting melee attack.

The Ancient Stone Beast holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth, greater identified as follows:

----------------- uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10}----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 3d9+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your toughness attribute by +10.

(earthquake + corruption when 'U'sed)

3.9 Sharad-Waador's quest and the blue dragon caves

Sharad-Waador is an ancient karmic wyrm found in the unreal cave system branch off the CoC 
at D: 46 or D: 47. He is found on level 4. He is nonhostile and will assign a quest to kill 
an ancient blue wyrm, Srraxxarrakex, who is his mortal enemy. This is a difficult quest and 
is in no way necessary to finish the game. Part of the difficulty is the presence of 
Srraxxarrakex's children: many different blue dragons including ancient blue dragons which 
see invisible. Blue dragons breathe lightning bolts, which will damage a PC without very 
good resistance or immunity as well as destroying items, both worn and in the pack. There 
is no way to prevent the item destruction. Items can be left in Sharad-Waador's room for 
safekeeping while on the quest. Sharad-Waador does not move unless he is attacked or the PC 
reneges on the deal to take the quest.

To receive the quest, the PC must first decide what equipment will be left behind, drop it, 
stand on the down staircase in Sharad-Waador's room, then 'C'hat with him. This sequence of 
events is necessary because Sharad-Waador will not chat with the PC until the PC is on the 
down stairs, and after chatting with the PC demands that the PC descend immediately. If the 
PC moves off the staircase at this point, Sharad-Waador becomes hostile.  A trick that can 
be used is leaving some of the PC's precious but 'might be needed' equipment *on* the 
stairway.  Sharad-Waador does not become hostile if the PC emerges from the blue dragon 
caves without moving from the stairway.  This provides a means of protecting very valuable 
equipment (such as scrolls of chaos resistance) that might be needed to save the PC's life.

The blue dragon caves consist of five levels, DL: 1-5. In addition to the many varied blue 
dragons found in these caves, other nasty high level monsters may be found here, including 
chaos wizards and greater molochs, for example. It is wise to have some means of dealing 
with greater molochs along, whether it is simply speed for running away, phase daggers or 
demon slayers. High speed is virtually essential for killing Srraxxarrakex, as well. Upon 
entering the fifth and final level of the caves, the following message is generated: "These 
ancient caves are covered with marks from huge reptiles... hundreds of such marks." 
Srraxxarrakex will be found on this level.

When the blue dragon caves were first implemented, there were complaints that the quest was 
impossible due to the item destruction. The amount of item destruction has been toned down 
a bit in more recent gammas, and some players will actually scum these caves because 
killing the blue dragons generates large amounts of valuable equipment, sometimes including 
very valuable items such as scrolls of chaos resistance or rings of djinni summoning.

The main reason for taking this quest however, is because Sharad-Waador rewards the PC with 
a huge pile of equipment for completing it. Among this equipment, which generally does not 
contain anything remarkable, is the artifact dagger Needle. Be very careful with this pile of 
equipment.  Needle is indistinguishable from ordinary daggers until it is identified.  It is 
best to have a blessed scroll of identify at the ready, to identify all the treasure the PC 
has taken from the blue dragon caves and the heap of stuff Sharad-Waador provides.  The junk 
can then be safely dropped without risking misplacing Needle.  When Needle is combined with 
its twin, the artifact dagger Sting, held by the Assassin Prince, they become the most 
powerful weapons in the game, at least in terms of raw to-hit and to-damage. If a PC planning 
an ultra ending makes it this far, check section 2.11.3.1 and get the Filk quest from the 
Assassin Prince. He can then be killed for Sting, if desired.


3.9.1 Srraxxarrakex

Sraxxarrakex is a very powerful ancient blue wyrm, more powerful than any other ancient 
wyrm in the game. He is, as might be expected, immune to shock. One of the things that 
makes him so difficult to defeat is the fact that he naturally regenerates *and* casts 
powerful healing spells at the same time. He has three attacks per round, so he can, for 
instance, breathe a lightning bolt, attack in melee, cast heal, while still getting natural 
regeneration *per round*. His vital statistics:

You examine Srraxxarrakex, the ancient blue wyrm. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 60, PV: 40, Hits: 951, Attacks: 3, Damage: 20-76. Speed: 113.

This means the PC must be capable of dealing massive amounts of damage quickly in order to 
defeat him. He can be attacked in almost any way, including melee, missiles and magic. He 
is of course vulnerable to dragon slaying missiles and melee weapons.

Killing him is worth 1.6 million experience points.


3.10 The Mana Temple

The Mana Temple is found on its own level, MT, the last level of the UL, the unreal cave 
system. The UL is a side branch off the main CoC at D: 46 or D: 47. The layout, on the 
right side of the level, is as follows:


 #################
 #........./.....#                        ############################
 #.........#####.###################      #^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^#

                                            ###


The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation does not work on this level. The walls of the Mana 
Temple itself are undiggable. It must be entered through the single square room at the 
southwest of the Temple. Note the traps completely surrounding the Temple. Ceiling traps 
replace teleportation traps in the Mana Temple. The numeral 1 is used to indicate secret 
doors. Note the underscore in the eastern center of the temple. This is the chaotic 
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until he is disturbed and moves). 
The standard warning about standing on altars applies - many of the monsters are capable of 
speech and will sacrifice the PC. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions 
of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in 
the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Mana Temple are arrayed 
as follows:

They are: e - magebane eyes
          e - magedoom eyes
          C - chaos servants
          C - annihilators
          C - chaos wizards
          @ - Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage

To attack the temple, the PC must travel through the trap-filled tunnel around the temple. 
During this, the magebane eyes and magedoom eyes will be draining the power points of the 
PC. Classes which are dependent on power points are well advised to bring along blessed 
scrolls of power. If possible, a wand of trap detection should be saved for the Mana 
Temple. This is a much faster way of detecting the traps than using the Detect Traps skill, 
especially when combined with the Farsight spell or a necklace of the eye. The faster this 
tunnel is traversed, the less time the eyes have to drain the PP of the PC. The Mana Temple 
ranks with the nastiest places in the game. Many players do not enter the temple itself, 
instead staying in the corridor. Using this technique, the monsters can be fought one at a 
time. Even so, the chaos wizards are summoners, so the PC can still be surrounded by 
summoned monsters in the corridor. The objective using this method is to wait for 
Nuurag-Vaarn to exit the temple, kill him, collect the Orb and flee.


3.10.1 Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage

Nuurag-Vaarn is a difficult opponent, to say the least. He has a corrupting melee attack. 
He is very fond of casting spells, especially Death Ray and Darkness. Entering the Mana 
Temple without a means of death ray resistance is virtual suicide. He is also very good at 
confusing the PC and is a stat drainer. He is immune to elemental attacks other than acid. 
He is vulnerable to humanoid slaying ammo; this is a good way to attack him if the PC can 
maintain a clear shot at him through all the monsters, summoned and otherwise, in the 
temple.

Nuurag-Vaarn's vital statistics:

You examine Nuurag-Vaarn, the invisible Chaos Archmage. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 60, PV: 30, Hits: 938, Attacks: 2, Damage: 9-36. Speed: 112.

To summarize the prerequisites needed to fight Nuurag-Vaarn:

1 - Death Ray resistance - essential
2 - confusion resistance - essential
3 - light source - essential
4 - humanoid slaying ammo - recommended

Nuurag-Vaarn holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana, greater identified as follows:

------------------ uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana {Ma+10}----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d16+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +10.

(full PP, +12 to PP, +3 Mana, corruption when 'U'sed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.11 D: 48

Warning: following the procedures on this page is irreversible. The PC cannot return to 
the higher levels of the CoC. Have everything you will need with you before proceeding.

Level 48 of the Caverns of Chaos contains five elemental anomalies corresponding to the 
five Chaos Orbs. They are guarded by four elemental grues with the usual corrupting grue 
melee attack. The mana anomaly is not guarded by a grue, but rather a chaos wizard. The 
idea here is to 'U'se each Chaos Orb while standing on the appropriate elemental anomaly. 
A transcript of the results and some remarks follow:

Mana anomaly - green underscore:
--------------------------------
You face a strange small rift in the air leading into unknown dimensions of pure energy.

Do you want to drop the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana into the rift? [y/N]

You drop the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana into the strange rift.

For some seconds a strange silence fills the whole level.

Suddenly the rift disappears.
--------------------------------

Using the mana orb in this way causes the PC's power points to drop to zero and a loss 
of two points of the Mana attribute.  For this reason, spellcasters may want to do this 
anomaly first, to allow the maximum time for PP to regenerate.  Blessed scrolls of power 
are very useful here.

Earth anomaly - brown underscore:
---------------------------------
You face a man-high stone column with a round opening in the center.

Do you want to put the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the hole? [y/N]

You fit the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the stone column.

For some seconds the whole level is shaking.

Suddenly the column disappears.
---------------------------------

The shaking of the level seems to imply some sort of minor earthquake, but the level 
takes no damage as a result.

Water anomaly - blue underscore
-------------------------------
You face a shimmering pool of unknown depth.

Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into shimmering 
pool? [y/N]

You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into the shimmering pool.

For some seconds the air gets very humid on this level.

Suddenly the humidity dispenses and everything is normal once more.
-------------------------------

The humidity generated by this operation will damage anything vulnerable to water damage 
- be careful, have waterproof blankets, do not have unprotected iron armor or weapons 
exposed.

Air anomaly - bright blue underscore
------------------------------------
You face a man-high whirlwind rising out of a hole in the ground.

Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the 
whirlwind? [y/N]

You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the whirlwind.

For some seconds a roaring wind soars through this level.

Suddenly everything is silent and the whirlwind disappears.
------------------------------------

This roaring wind seems to do no damage.

Fire anomaly - red underscore
-----------------------------
You face a man-high bonfire.

Do you want to throw the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the 
roaring bonfire? [y/N]

You throw the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the bonfire.

For some seconds the whole level is filled with an immense heat. You resist the searing 
flames.

Suddenly the level cools down once more and the bonfire is gone.
-----------------------------

The fire anomaly is by far the most dangerous. It will damage anything vulnerable to fire. 
This includes any monsters that may be wandering the level. That includes cats. It is very 
disappointing and frustrating to kill a cat in this way and have the hard-fought-for Ring 
of the Master Cat explode at this point. Zap a wand of monster detection or read a scroll 
of monster detection before using the fire orb in the anomaly. It also damages a 
necromancer PC's slaves. It may not kill them, but undead are vulnerable to fire damage, 
and a partially fried and very angry extremely experienced level 110 quickling king lich 
is not something the PC wants to worry about at this point. Leave undead slaves on D: 47. 
Pets, companions and slaves cannot cross D: 49 anyway.

After all of the orbs are in their proper places, the PC receives the following message:

You hear a grating sound in the distance.

This means the up staircase has reversed direction and now points down. There is no way to 
return to D: 47 at this point. The PC is now committed to going through D: 49 to D: 50, 
either to win or die.


3.12 D: 49

Level 49 of the Caverns of Chaos is called the frictionless level by many players. It is 
covered with ice that is too slippery to cross by normal means. Spiked boots do not help. 
Teleportation fails on this level. Since the ice is (almost) frictionless, throwing objects 
will propel the PC in the opposite direction (remember freshman physics?). There is also a 
special gift available on this level. If the PC equips a potion of uselessness in the 
missile slot and throws it, a deity rewards the PC for finding a use for the potion with a 
random artifact. The following messages are typical of those generated upon entering and 
throwing a potion of uselessness:

There is a stair leading downwards here.
You climb downwards...
The ground seems to be covered with a very slippery layer of ice. It's cold here! 
There is a stair leading upwards here.
[T]arget -- [Z] Abort. (x2)
The uncursed potion of uselessness thuds into an obstacle. The uncursed potion of 
uselessness shatters! You slide to the west. You suddenly hear a booming voice!
"*YE REALLY HAST FOUND A USE FOR THIS PETTY ITEM*"
"*YER INGENUITY SHALL BE REWARDED*"
Something is lying before you. Out of ammunition.
Reload with the heap of 14 uncursed rocks (+1, 1d4)? ([y]es, [n]o, [q]uit) Q
Blessed shining silver bracers (10s) are lying here. You shudder. You resist the icy blast.
You pick up the blessed shining silver bracers. You sneeze. You resist the icy blast.

This particular PC was very lucky and received the Bracers of War. As mentioned the 
artifact is random and can be potentially worthless. Note the cold-related messages. This 
is troublesome for drakelings, who will find themselves frozen nearly solid. A reduction in 
speed to 10 is typical. If the player is aware of this, it is not a huge problem. Upon 
entering CoC 50, cast Improved Fireball adjacent to the PC or zap a wand of fire at the 
PC's location repeatedly until speed is reasonable again.

The following map shows the results of using rocks and a sling to travel through CoC 49. 
Note the rocks are closer together in the final central corridor. This was deliberately 
done to show the results changing when the PC switched from a sling of the long shot to a 
normal sling. Use whatever is handy, effective and expendable to travel through CoC 49 - 
rocks, arrows, guaranteed returning missiles such as a boomerang, even that worthless pile 
of sis the PC has been dragging around forever. Do NOT use missile weapons that are not 
guaranteed to return such as the rune-covered trident or the Hammer of the Gods. Given the 
nature of CoC 49, the PC may never be able to stop exactly where they fell to retrieve 
them.

The walls of D: 49 are diggable with the Mystic Shovel spell, a wand of digging, a pickaxe, 
the Elementalist class power and a monk's kicking ability. Monks using their ability will 
be propelled backward one square, and the rock may or may not shatter, making this 
technique somewhat awkward. The newly dug area remains too slippery to cross. This offers 
drakelings a potentially faster way through D: 49.


                                                                          ###

3.13 D: 50

Level 50 of the Caverns of Chaos is the final battleground for those not attempting an 
ultra ending. It is appropriately challenging. The Mana Temple will have provided an idea 
of what CoC 50 will be like for PCs that make it this far. There will undoubtedly be many 
additions and revisions to this section.

The level layout on the left side of the level is as follows:


############                             #######
#&.........#                             #.....#

#&.........############      #######       #################################
############


The numeral 1 represents secret doors.

The right side of the level is random. Note the dungeon features. The & symbols in this map 
do not represent demons but rather levers. These control the state of the Chaos Gate, 
represented by the 8 in the large central room. These features cannot be seen in the color 
map on the web site.

Note that all of the & symbols in the color map *do* represent balors - there are balors 
standing on the levers.

There are two basic ways to finish CoC 50: The object of the level is to 'h'andle both of 
the levers, thus closing the Chaos Gate and ending the incursion of chaos into Ancardia. 
This can initially be accomplished by clearing the northern and southern corridors and 
'h'andling the levers. However, some of the monsters on CoC 50 are intelligent enough to 
reopen the gate. To ensure that the levers remain in their closed position, the PC has two 
choices: ensure the levers remain in their closed position forever, or make sure the 
following intelligent monsters are all dead: Fistanarius, balors, ghost lords and chaos 
wizards.

A third alternative is available for those PCs who aspire to a special ending, which 
require Chaos Gate entry. Much of the combat on D: 50 can be bypassed as soon as it is 
possible to teleport to the location of the Chaos Gate. In order to do this, Fistanarius, 
the greater balor, must move from his position on top of the Chaos Gate. See section 4 
Special Endings, for more about the (extensive) requirements for attempting a special 
ending.

Wands of destruction ending

One relatively easy way to finish CoC 50 is to use wands of destruction. This, and the 
variation using wands of door creation / monster creation below, require substantially less 
combat than a traditional ending. The level is diggable, so it is possible to tunnel into 
the northern and southern corridors and clear them. Remember they are closed by secret 
doors. During this, some of the intelligent monsters may sense what is happening - ghost 
lords may pass through the walls, balors may teleport in. When both corridors are cleared, 
'h'andle one of the levers to close it. Zap a wand of destruction to destroy it in its 
closed state. This will open the walls to the large central room and make all of those 
monsters pursue the PC. Teleport to the other lever, 'h'andle it to close it and zap a wand 
of destruction to destroy it. Teleport to the up staircase and leave. You've won. Here is 
an example of what the level might look like after doing this:

Note most of the balors, but not Fistanarius, have teleported to search for the PC. The 
chaos mutants in the center, the greater chaos servants in the central corridor, the 
writhing masses of primal chaos and most of the ghost lords have not even moved.

Wands of door creation / monster creation ending

This is a variation on the above technique. It is somewhat safer in that the big room never 
has to be opened at all, but both wands of door creation with at least six total charges 
and a wand of monster creation with two charges are required. 

This method starts with the same approach as outlined above - clear the northern and 
southern corridors after entering them by digging. Zap a wand of door creation twice to 
almost enclose one of the levers. Handle the lever to close it. Zap a wand of monster 
creation to create a monster on the closed lever to prevent balors from teleporting to that 
space. Zap a wand of door creation to trap the monster on that square. Teleport to the 
other lever and repeat. Teleport to the stairs and leave.

This method has some problems, as does the wands of destruction ending above. Regardless, 
they are much, much easier than the alternative of killing the intelligent monsters on the 
level. First, some monsters will open doors, so it may be necessary to keep zapping, 
killing the monster and repeating until something suitable is generated. Locking the door 
will solve this problem if the PC has an appropriate key, which he should by this time. 
Second, you must be quick, which is why teleportation is recommended. It is quite likely 
that the balors will start teleporting to investigate the levers, and they are quite 
capable of opening the doors or smashing them if locked, killing the monster standing on 
the lever and reactivating the lever. Third is simply a philosophical problem. The PC has 
not really fulfilled the requirements for winning, but is taking advantage of the fact that 
the level will remain frozen after he leaves. Nonetheless, the game counts this as a win.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4.                           SPECIAL ENDINGS


4.1 Andor Drakon

Andor Drakon is the ElDeR cHaOs GoD, the source of all the trouble in Ancardia. He resides 
on the ChAoS plane, which lies beyond the chaos gate. Any PC who wants to attempt a special 
ending will have to face him. The requirements for passing through the chaos gate vary 
according to alignment and whether the PC wants to attempt the normal chaos god ending or 
an ultra ending, and are detailed in the sections regarding the endings.

It is a good idea to remove the Chaos artifacts necessary for gate passage immediately upon 
arrival on the ChAoS plane. Furthermore, drop them. They are no longer needed and only 
serve to further corrupt the PC, which is going to happen rapidly anyway because of the 
corrupting nature of the ChAoS plane. Read all scrolls of chaos resistance. Drink all 
potions of cure corruption.

Andor Drakon is, as might be imagined, a formidable enemy. He is fast, with a speed of 217 
the last time it was checked several gammas ago. He is invisible. He casts what are 
apparently death rays, has a corrupting melee attack in addition to the naturally 
corrupting chaos plane, paralyzes, summons, casts darkness, teleports and drains stats and 
power points at a fearsome rate.

His speed was gleaned from the Monster Memory which is otherwise not helpful, stating that 
he is beyond description. He also seems to be immune to the effects of a blessed 
stethoscope.

How to deal with him?  Have a massively powerful melee attack.  Drink all stat boosting 
potions prior to gate entry.  Be very, very fast, the faster the better, preferably speed 
should be intrinsically above 200 and boosted above 400.  Have excellent PV and DV.  Have 
every resistance possible.  If the PC is not paralyzation resistant, an amulet of free 
action (or the Boots of the Divine Messenger, for instance) is essential.  A light source 
is essential.  He is vulnerable to humanoid slaying ammo.  He has been killed in many 
different ways, including using the Acid Ball spell in a previous gamma version of the game.  
Relying on spells on the chaos plane is not currently recommended, since Andor Drakon now 
drains PP very rapidly and claims that using magic strengthens him.  In practice use of 
magic seems to make him faster.  Prayer is definitely something to be avoided on the ChAoS 
plane under any circumstances.  It causes greater balors to be summoned.

If a PC has much trouble on D: 50, it does not bode well as far as defeating Andor Drakon 
goes. He often defeats PC's who have *no* trouble on D: 50 (but are perhaps not as spoiled 
as those reading this).


4.2 The Chaos God ending

The Chaos God ending was the first special ending available in ADOM, as of gamma 6 (?). 
Today it has become kind of old-fashioned. Victory posts with "ordinary" Chaos Gods are few 
and far between. One reason it has fallen out of favor is because the future history of the 
PC after winning is bleak: after going to all the trouble necessary to even meet, much less 
defeat Andor Drakon, the PC revels in his glory for some time but is ultimately vanquished 
by a Champion of Law. Still, it is the only means of accessing a special ending if 
Khelavaster cannot be saved, which is very difficult. It is also the only way to achieve a 
special ending with a pure chaotic: a PC that starts chaotic and stays that way for the 
entire game. That in itself is quite an accomplishment.


4.2.1 Requirements

In order to achieve the Chaos God ending the PC must meet several requirements. These are 
checked during passage through the Chaos Gate. He must be C-. He must be a crowned Champion 
of Chaos. He must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely 
corrupted). If these criteria are not met, the PC is shredded to pieces by any of several 
guardians or the millions of Chaos denizens Andor Drakon has collected (the exact guardian 
who kills the PC will have to wait for further testing, however, from memory, it is 
something like multi-tentacled horrors of unspeakable might check C- alignment, a chaos 
knight checks for crowned Champion of Chaos and says "I bow before thee, my lord!" if the 
requirement is met and the millions of Chaos denizens check the requirement for extremely 
corrupted; a successful check causes them to chant "One of us! One of us!"). Further, the 
PC must have the Chaos Trinity properly equipped: wear the Crown and Medal of Chaos, wield 
the Sceptre of Chaos in the right hand, leave the left hand empty. If this requirement is 
not met, Andor Drakon blasts the PC to oblivion. A successful check results in a message 
from Andor Drakon along the lines of "You seem to be wearing the insignia correctly. iT 
wIlL bE a PlEaSuRe To ShReD yOu In MeLeE!" If all of this is met, the PC winds up on the 
ChAoS plane to face Andor Drakon. The PC must be wielding the Sceptre of Chaos when Andor 
Drakon dies, although it is probably not necessary to kill him with the Sceptre 
(beastfighters would have difficulty doing this, but not killing him with a missile weapon 
while wielding the Sceptre).


4.3 Ultra endings

The Ultra endings were available as of gamma ten. In this gamma, the restriction on Chaos 
Gate entry for chaotics only was removed. However, the PC needs to have a mythical and long 
searched-for weapon - the Trident of the Red Rooster (TotRR). The steps necessary to obtain 
it are listed below.

One problem with the ultra endings is the necessity of changing alignment more than once at 
a relatively advanced stage of the game. All PCs attempting an Ultra ending must procure 
the Crown of Chaos and Medal of Chaos. In order to receive the quests for the Medal of 
Chaos from Gaab'Baay the PC must be at some flavor of chaotic alignment. There are six 
quests total, the first of which is to "satisfy the mutated one" which refers to completing 
the demented ratling's demand for six artifacts. The demented ratling will also only talk 
to chaotics. The demented ratling reveals the secret of the Stone Circle, where Keriax, the 
multi-headed chaos dragon who holds the Crown of Chaos resides. In practice the PC is 
usually fully C by the time the Medal of Chaos is obtained, since the quests for the Medal 
of Chaos involve killing a farmer, usually a non-hostile monster. After receiving the Medal 
of Chaos, the PC is free to change alignment, since the Stone Circle can be entered 
regardless of alignment. Remember the PC must change back to at least some flavor of 
neutral alignment in order to retrieve the TotRR. Khelavaster will not summon the TotRR for 
chaotics. The problem becomes more vexing since the longer high level PCs remain chaotic, 
the more difficult it is to change alignment back towards neutrality or law, becoming very 
difficult at experience level 50. There have been two reports of a C PC changing back to 
neutrality at experience level 50. The first sacrificed small amounts of gold between 100 
- 200 times using two separate neutral altars (the first altar's alignment changed during 
the sacrificing). The second used the same technique with a single lawful altar. The PC 
must balance the necessity of changing alignment as *early* as possible in order to get 
back to neutrality with the necessity to change as *late* as possible in order to satisfy 
Gaab'Baay's quests, some of which involve delivering rare or precious items (a scroll of 
danger and a potion of cure corruption respectively). If the PC has wishes to spare, of 
course, this is not a problem. In practice all of this should be done by about experience 
level 40 - 45 at most, ideally sooner although scrolls of danger can be near-impossible to 
find.

Malte Helmert elaborates further on this phenomenon; the PC in question is experience 
level 50:

> I'm currently playing a dwarven bard in g16pre2 going for an ULE. He has the Trident,
> Orbs and two Trinity parts - the only thing that is still lacking is the L+ alignment. 
> Saccing small amounts of money took me from C to LN. Unfortunately, you can't get 
> further than that with altars. Even saccing millions of gp doesn't work, I checked 
> with another character using WADOMF. It seems like altars only change your alignment 
> (at least at high level) if you are of a different alignment than the altar (this
> does not seem in keeping with my previous experience, so maybe it is not valid for 
> lower-level characters and in any case needs to be investigated more thoroughly).
> 
> So the question is, how do you get to L+ again when you're level 50? 
>
> I found three ways:
>
> * giving food to beggars. One blessed or uncursed stomafillia gives 2 "stones" on the 
> alignment scale, giving more yields more stones (100 gives 200, but it looks like there 
> is an upper bound or something, as 1000 didn't give 2000). I didn't check too much with 
> other food, but it also seems to have an effect (made some experiments with large 
> rations), but less so, probably depending on their satiation value.
>
> * giving money to beggars. Giving less than 1000 doesn't have an effect, giving 1000 or 
> more (no matter how many) gives 1 stone.
>
> * healing your pet. This gives 6 stones (tested with Cure Light Wounds and Heal), but it 
> only works when your pet is actually wounded. So you'd want to find a way of getting your 
> pet constantly hurt but not killed. This isn't exactly easy.
> 
> As LN starts at 1000 stones on the white side and L+ ranges from 5000 to 6000 stones, the 
> "easiest" way of getting there seems to be giving 4-5 millions of gold to beggars in 
> steps of 1000 - if you have the money and can perform one give action in two seconds, 
> it'll still take more than two hours. It follows that this is a major PITA, so you'd 
> better do the chaos quests early if going for an ULE. This is no problem for the UNE, as 
> altars can get you to N= fairly easily.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: all of the above has seemingly been made moot by the March 25th, 2002 
discovery by Queff Himalaya that a level 50 chaotic PC (although a C- PC has not been 
tested) can move to neutral alignment in one turn by giving the Dwarftown Priest 
1,000,000 gold pieces.  This is obviously less tedious than the methods above and much 
less dangerous than sacrificing at altars.  It also may be removed by Thomas in future 
versions, so be careful.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT UPDATE: it has been discovered (April 11th, 2002) that giving gold to the 
Dwarftown Priest, even with a high level C- PC, can change the PC's alignment. High level 
(48) PC's that were C- were able to achieve LN status using this method, when the Dwarftown 
altar was generated as a lawful altar. Note that the status is only LN. Further measures 
are necessary if the PC wants to achieve L+ status.

All of the above has another implication - the PC cannot be crowned until the Medal of 
Chaos (or the TotRR itself, if an Ultimate Chaos God ending is planned) is obtained. Fallen 
champions will never receive the TotRR nor survive passage through the Chaos gate, so the 
nice benefits of crowning must be deferred until the Medal of Chaos or TotRR are obtained.


4.3.1 The Trident of the Red Rooster

The Trident of the Red Rooster is the ultimate weapon available in ADOM. Its 
characteristics can be found in Appendix L, but more importantly, it allows passage through 
the Chaos Gate regardless of alignment. Retrieving it is a lengthy process outlined below.


4.3.1.1 The Filk quest

The Filk quest is available from the Assassin Prince, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel, once 
three requirements are met. They are: the PC is at least experience level 45, the PC has 
successfully taken Sharad-Waador's quest and slain Srraxxarrakex and the PC has in his 
possession the artifact dagger Needle which is one of the rewards Sharad-Waador provides 
for killing Srraxxarrakex. After receiving the quest, the PC may elect to kill the Assassin 
Prince since he carries Needle's companion dagger Sting. Dual-wielded, they are enormously 
powerful. The object of the quest is to kill Filk, a named quickling bard.

The Assassin Prince gives some cryptic hints provided by the Mad Minstrel about Filk's 
location. They mean that Filk can be found on the level of the ID corresponding to the 
number of first-killed monsters killed. Note that this number can change as the quest 
proceeds. As a quickling, he is obviously fast, but Filk is the fastest of them all with a 
speed of 1500. When attacking Filk, note two things: he has the highest DV of any monster 
in the game at 500 but a PV of zero. Needless to say he is difficult to hit. However, once 
he is hit he is easily killed. He also shares the properties of karmics, although he is not 
named as such. Use missiles, wands, spells, mindcraft or companions to kill him.


4.3.1.2 The Mad Minstrel

After the Filk quest is completed, the PC should visit the Mad Minstrel. He will provide 
access to and information about the location of the Scintillating Cave (found in the 
western part of the wilderness south of the RotHK caves very close to the Ruined City).


4.3.1.3 The Scintillating Cave

The Scintillating Cave consists of eight cavernous levels. As one of the last places the PC 
will visit, it is dangerous and has a high generation rate featuring very dangerous 
monsters. Ancient Karmic Dragons, Greater Molochs and Emperor Lichs are common. It is best 
to simply get to the down staircases as quickly as possible unless the PC is an absolute 
walking tank by this time (which some aspiring to Ultra endings are). The objective is to 
find the down staircase to the lair of the Emperor Moloch.


4.3.1.3.1 The Emperor Moloch

By this time the PC has probably faced Greater Molochs and can imagine what the Emperor 
Moloch will be like. Extraordinary PV, not much DV, slow and hits like a ton of bricks. In 
addition, the level he resides on is massively corrupting. He must be killed quickly or 
lured off the level. He is vulnerable to phase daggers, ball spells, high effectivity bolt 
spells, demon slaying missiles including the rune-covered trident (although it is not 
guaranteed to return) and greater telekinetic blast. The twin daggers are not effective. 
When killed, he drops two guaranteed items: the crumpled scroll and a moloch armor weighing 
15000 stones(!). The crumpled scroll is the key to the TotRR.


4.3.1.4 Khelavaster in Terinyo

At this stage in the game Khelavaster can be found in Terinyo. He is invisible. When given 
the crumpled scroll, he will summon the TotRR. Remember the PC must be of neutral or lawful 
alignment.


4.3.2 The Avatar of Order ending

To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate 
as a crowned L+ Champion of Law wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. 
The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos 
artifacts. There is no corruption requirement. Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR.


4.3.3 The Avatar of Balance ending

To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate 
as a crowned N= Champion of Balance wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the 
TotRR. The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the 
Chaos artifacts. The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC 
is extremely corrupted). Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR.


4.3.4 The Ultimate Chaos God ending

To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate 
as a crowned C- Champion of Chaos wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. 
The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos 
artifacts. The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is 
extremely corrupted). Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR.

5.                        UNRESOLVED MYSTERIES


5.1 Kherab's third quest and the reward

When you've done the first two quests for Kherab, the dwarven artificer in Darkforge, he 
tells you to "be patient, more will have to be done soon". However, he will never assign 
the third quest, even to experience level 50 characters who are ready to close the chaos 
gate or attempt an ultra ending. From scanning the executable, reference to a "spear of 
raw steel" has been found, seemingly a third quest reward along with the amulet of raw 
steel and shield of raw steel now available.

5.2 The Scroll of Omnipotence

In the secret compartment of the High Mountain Village, there's a message that reads:

"Dear Lubaf, I am sorry to disappoint you but you won't be able to find the Scroll of 
Omnipotence in this place. I have hidden it more effectively. You will need to find the 
red rooster at dawn. Then you'll encounter the final challenge. 

With passionate hate,
Alhacrast, Overlord of Jak-Nagiur."

This may be what Khelavaster refers to as the foolish legends that built up around the 
quest for the crumpled scroll and the Trident of the Red Rooster.

5.3 The Red Rooster Inn

The Red Rooster Inn is mentioned in the executable and is probably a red herring. It was 
thought in earlier versions of ADOM that the innkeeper would produce the Trident of the 
Red Rooster in the Red Rooster Inn at dawn.

5.4 The Volcano

There is a volcano mentioned in the executable, but no character has ever found such a 
location. It may be a remnant left over from earlier development of ADOM, possibly 
designed to be the location where the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire could be found prior 
to implementation of the Tower of Eternal Flames.

5.5 The Weird Tome

The Ghost Librarian in the Library of Niltrias demands silence.  In practice, this 
means the PC must spend a certain amount of time in the Library without speaking.  
Spellcasting is allowed.  After spending the required number of turns (unknown, but 
well spent reading spellbooks) without speaking, upon 'C'hatting with him, he gives 
the PC the weird tome. He instructs the PC to deliver it to the Mad Minstrel, who will 
in turn reward the PC with five cursed scrolls of chaos resistance.

The mystery about the book is the fact that nobody has managed to read it.

See section 2.22.2.1 for more details about the Ghost Librarian and the weird tome.

The amulets with a numerical modifier above are base value in g16p2.  There 
are others available.  The numerical modifier can be {base value} +/- 3.  
Amulets of speed, however, are always (+3 spd).  Extensive testing was done 
by wishing for amulets of the cold heart and amulets of defense.  For the 
statisticians among the readers, the results are shown below.  The PC had no 
amulets before this.  The test was done on PC: 1 with an experience level 
one PC who wished for the amulets 100 times.  

The results were as follows:

   A - heap of 215 uncursed amulets of the cold heart {Ch-12}           [645s]
   B - heap of 26 blessed amulets of the cold heart {Ch-12}              [78s]

   O - heap of 2 uncursed amulets of defense +0                           [6s]
   L - uncursed amulet of defense -1                                      [3s]
   M - cursed amulet of defense +0                                        [3s]
   N - blessed amulet of defense +4                                       [3s]
   O - blessed amulet of defense +3                                       [3s]

The results may conceivably vary depending on the danger level of the dungeon 
or the blessed/uncursed/cursed status of the wand of wishing.  This will be 
investigated in the future.  The wand used for these tests was uncursed.

A couple of days after this was all figured out, a level 50 PC on D: 50 found 
an amulet of the cold heart {Ch-16}.  It was dropped by a great wyrm.  So it 
seems that the +/- 3 is only a very good guide to amulets, not an ironclad rule.

Thanks to ToGu for contributing the odds of obtaining weapons with a prefix, suffix or both:

Prefixes and suffixes are evenly distributed.
4/6 of items have a chance to have a prefix.
4/6 of items have a chance to have a suffix.
2/6 of items have a chance to have both a prefix and a suffix.

The chance to actually get the prefix/suffix is then 1/(10-(LEVEL/10))

For a L50 character this means:
Prefix: (4/6)/(10-(50/10)) = 2/15 = 13.3333%
Suffix: (4/6)/(10-(50/10)) = 2/15 = 13.3333%
Both: (2/6)/(10-(50/10))/(10-(50/10)) = 1/75 = 1.3333%

Fo a L1 character this means:
Prefix: (4/6)/(10-(1/10)) = 2/30 = 6.6667%
Suffix: (4/6)/(10-(1/10)) = 2/30 = 6.6667%
Both: (2/6)/(10-(1/10))/(10-(1/10)) = 1/300 = 0.3333%

[1] Scrolls of defense and protection affect only the following worn items in this order: armor, helmet, cloak, boots, gauntlets, 
girdle, bracers. Cursed SoD and SoP always decrease DV or PV by one. Blessed SoD and SoP may increase items with low DV or PV by 
two or three points.

Scrolls can be written if the PC is literate, has seen an example of the scroll, 
has a magical writing set and a blank scroll to write on. Blank scrolls can be 
found in the dungeons (an unlabeled scroll), or they can be created by dipping 
other scrolls into *normal* water - not holy water or unholy water. Be aware that 
the cost for writing scrolls of chaos resistance is high - there is a permanent 
loss of two or three mana points for *wizards*, apparently depending on the blessed 
vs uncursed status of the magical writing set.  The mana cost for non-wizards is 
significantly higher, ten mana points is typical.  In addition, any combination of 
a blessed MWS with an uncursed blank scroll or an uncursed MWS with a blessed or 
uncursed blank scroll will result in a loss of hitpoints.  This loss ranged from 
70 to 145 HP with a WADOMF'd experience level one wizard PC.  The HP loss may go 
down with increasing experience level for wizards, but this has not been tested.  
The HP consequences for non-wizards may be more dramatic (i.e. deadly).

Writing other scrolls does not have such drastic consequences, though the exact 
effects have yet to be worked out.


6-G  Appendix G - Food - complete list


Thanks to Malte Helmert for working out all details of this Appendix

Most "base" PCs use one unit of nutrition each turn. The units of nutrition 
for the various food items are listed below. None of the following applies 
to food consumption in the big wilderness map, where different rules apply 
(maybe just a multiplier).

Apart from equipment, the formula for a PC's food consumption per turn is
as follows:

 1 is standard
+1 for Trolls
+1 when Strained or Strained!
+2 when Overburdened!

The total value after those modifiers is halved for Farmers of Level 12+
and monks of any level. So, for example, an overburdened human fighter
would consume 3 units per turn, and a strained! troll monk would consume
1.5 units per turn. In this case, fractions are *not* rounded away: The
character will alternate between consuming 1 and 2 units.

After that, additional modifiers apply, which are *not* halved for monks
or farmers:

+3    for each (!) equipped item granting Invisibility
+0.5  for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for uncrowned or fallen 
       champion PCs
+0.25 for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for crowned PCs
+15   in the wilderness, for non-Trolls
+30   in the wilderness, for Trolls
          

Food consumption in the wilderness is independent of movement speed, 
including seven league boots, and terrain type.

So, for example, a strained troll barbarian, crowned chaotic, wearing 7 
artifacts and one item granting Invisibility will consume 7 units per turn 
(1 standard, 1 troll, 1 strained, 7/4 rounded down = 1 for the artifacts, 
3 for the invisibility).

From all experiments conducted with WADOMF and g16pre2, there was no 
influence caused by:

* alignment (some suggested that only champions of law get the artifact 
             discount, but it is identical for chaotics and presumably
             neutrals)

* being a fallen champion (that is, there is no special penalty - it's
                           just like not being crowned)

* any corruption (the suspicious mana battery and corrupted
                  tissue corruptions were tested)

* any intrinsic (particularly, intrinsic invisiblity does not increase
                 food consumption - this was very surprising; likewise, 
                 the doomed/cursed/lucky/having Fate smile makes no 
                 difference

* the invisibility spell

* being a Healer or being born in the month of Candle

* HP or PP regeneration rate, having eaten Troll corpses, having drunk
  potions of troll blood or raw mana, wielding regenerating items - the
  last is very surprising


The different satiation categories are:

satiation level  2501+      : bloated
satiation level  1501..2500 : satiated
satiation level  200..1500  : normal
satiation level  100..199   : hungry
satiation level  50..99     : very hungry
satiation level  0..49      : starving

A character with satiation level 0 has a random chance of dying because
of starvation each turn. In g16p2 and later versions, apparently no food 
consumption takes place while eating, so it should be impossible to starve 
to death while eating (unlike previous versions).

     3 - unidentified appear as bit of candy; 
         can be identified by taste: plain = 'sweet', gnomish = 'annoyingly sweet'; 
         children will only accept plain candy
     4 - unidentified appear as seed
     5 - more nutritious for dark elves: cursed = 2010, uncursed =  1020, blessed = 125; 
         this unusual fact is in fact intentional
     6 - more nutritious for orcs (2X), trolls (3X), barbarians (3X) and beastfighters (3X); 
         if a PC falls into more than one category, only the higher bonus applies - i.e. 
         orcish beastfighters are 3X; drakelings receive a different message than other races 
         but get the usual 500 satiation points
     7 - Fried fish meat indeed has a fractional weight. If a stack of fried fish meat contains 
         an odd number of pieces, the weight of the stack is rounded up

Stomafillia herbs are different in that their b/u/c status is more
influential than for other food items: They yield 6250/2000/550 points of 
satiation depending on whether they are blessed, uncursed or cursed.

Stomacemptia herbs are the only non-corpse food items that lower the
satiation level. Even bad ratling food, despite yielding the "you vomit" 
message, satiates slightly. Stomacemptia herbs do not apply a fixed 
modifier but behave a bit differently:

If the character is not yet starving, the new satiation level is set to a 
fixed value depending on the b/u/c status of the herb (rows) and the old 
satiation value (columns):

          50..99     100..199   200..1500  1501+

blessed   49         99         199        1500
uncursed  49         49         99         199
cursed    49         49         49         49

Put in words, blessed herbs always set the satiation level to the highest 
possible value of the next lower category (from satiated to normal, from 
normal to hungry, from hungry to very hungry, from very hungry to 
starving), uncursed herbs go two such steps, and cursed herbs always go 
down to starving.

If the character is already starving (satiation value 0..49), then the
satiation value is decreased by 20, but not below 0, irrespective of b/u/c 
status of the herb.

It is possible to wish for "satiation" or "food". This sets the satiation 
level to 5000 if it was below this value. It does nothing otherwise.

Scrolls of satiation add 2000/1000/0 to the satiation level
if blessed/uncursed/cursed.

Apart from corpses, the only food items that can be cooked are raw meat 
and fish meat, as noted in the table. Unlike corpses, they can only be 
cooked with the cooking skill; fire destroys them.

From preliminary testing, it seems that apples and pieces of raw meat rot 
at approximately the same rate.

6-J  Appendix J - Monsters - complete list

This list is formulated as follows:

Monster name (unique name) - alignment (C, N or L)
Symbol
Special attacks and defenses
Corpse effects
Misc


Orb guardians are listed first.  The remainder of the monsters are listed 
alphabetically by name (not symbol).  The alphabetical listings are separated 
by triple letters corresponding to the first letter of the monster's name.  

For example, to search for a monster name that begins with G that you are 
uncertain of, search for GGG with your text editor and browse the list.  

Obviously, this list cannot be as explicit as the web site, since specific 
colors for those monsters that are represented by the same symbol in various 
colors cannot be specifically represented.

6-M  Appendix M - Wishing - suggestions


Wishing suggestions: naturally, any useful non-artifact item: amulet of life saving (if 
striving for an ultra ending), pairs of seven league boots ("pairs of" guarantees plurality), 
whips of the snake, phase daggers, swords of sharpness, maces of destruction (although Big 
Punch should be around already), eternium tower shields, eternium plate mails, eternium 
-weapon of choice-s, -color- dragon scale mail, rings of elemental mastery, and of course, 
scrolls of chaos resistance, as they work better than potions of cure corruption.

Also, wishes can yield any skill except for Alertness (which, when wished for, increases 
Perception) and Healing (which, when wished for, heals the PC). Stats can also be wished 
for - although, wishing for 'learning' yields potions of learning - wish for 'knowledge' 
to increase Learning directly.  Appearance has to be wished for as 'beauty' and Perception 
as 'alertness'. The size of the stat increase depends on the stat: 7 points of Willpower is 
possible, the Strength bonus is usually around 3 and as high as 5 - which makes it more 
worthwhile to wish for potions of strength instead.

A "manual of bridge building" can be wished for and the PC is able to learn 
the skill by reading it.  Wishing for "manuals of bridge building" results 
in the strange flux message then Nothing Happens.

If the PC wants to increase Learning, wishing for crystals of knowledge is better than 
wishing for potions of learning since blessed CoK's increase Learning by 1d2, you get 
three with one wish, and you can bless multiple CoK's with one potion of holy water, 
whereas you get two potions of learning, both of which take a potion of holy water to 
bless. With any decent kind of luck, the CoK's should bring at least 4, 5 or even 6 extra 
points to Learning.

Wishing for 'corruption' results in a corruptor.

Wishing for 'death' results in unnatural aging (76 years reproducibly with one human PC, 
this may be race and age dependent).

Wishing for 'invisibility' results in rings of invisibility.

Wishing for the plural form of certain items results in a message:

A voice in your mind booms...
"*ONE* SHALL BE ENOUGH!"
Your equipment feels heavier.

Items in this category include amulets of life saving, girdles of giant strength and 
potions of gain attributes. Certain other items can only be obtained two at a time. 
Examples include potions of -stat-.


Wishing for speed:

Stephen White has studied this in some detail and posted the following to RGRA on 
March 7th, 2002: 

> First I will mention that during the following testing I was
> careful to look out for things like base modification of
> speed due to burden or hunger status - I was always not even
> burdened, and always of no specific hunger status, i.e. not
> satiated or hungry, just normal.

> OK, I just tested this out. I wished for "potions of boost speed"
> 10 times. I got only two potions twice, three potions six times,
> and four potions twice, so we can assume the average is three
> per wish.

> I blessed them all, and drank them one at a time, allowing my
> speed to return to normal between each one. The lowest speed
> boost given was 21 points, which occured three times. The
> highest was 47, acheived just once. The average overall was
> 30.8 speed points from one blessed potion.

> This gives an overall total (assuming three potions from an
> average wish, and average gain from each) of 92.4 points.

> Then I tried wishing for "speed" directly, 12 times. I let my
> speed return to normal after each, and took account of the
> permanent increase of 1 point left over after the boost wears
> off. The minimum boost I received was 150 points, the maximum
> was 248 points. The overall average was 214.2 points.

> So, this is pretty conclusive - it's best to wish for "speed"
> directly. It's *possible* to gain more by using potions, if

> increase.

The original context of the thread was in regard to techniques useful when fighting 
Andor Drakon. High speed is also useful when fighting Srraxxarrakex, the emperor 
moloch, or other monsters the PC just doesn't want to be hit by.


Results from some unusual wishes:

The game's direct response is [in square brackets].

babes - ["We are feeling lonely, aren't we?"]

crumpled scroll - Wishing for 'crumpled scroll' results in a blank scroll.

friends - [A telepathic voice sounds in your head: "Thou shalt have a friend!". 
          A -foo- appears!] A tame animal pet or a companion.

immortality - ["Funny, very funny."]

moloch armor - Wishing for moloch armor results in eternium plate mail.

money or gold - [Suddenly gold pieces rain down upon you!] About 43,000 gold pieces.

sheep - The parser interprets this as a wish for a banshee.  Be prepared.<p>

Thomas Biskup - [A voice booms... "*Thou shalt not mock the Creator*!"]

Underwater creatures - wishing for a giant eel or a shark or dragon turtle
while not in Shyssiryxius' cave, results in [A tiny red herring appears for a few seconds...]<p>

If underwater creatures are wished for when surrounded by water (in the middle of a river, the
Terinyo island, etc), the game responds with [For some seconds a ghostly figure seems to appear,
 but then it dissipates once more.]<p>

Wishing for underwater creatures in Shyssiryxius' cave results in the creatures as normal.<p>

wands of wishing, rings of djinni summoning, spellbooks of Wish, wishes, etc: Wishing for 
wands of wishing results in a wand of wonder; rings of djinni summoning results in brass 
rings, spellbooks of Wish results in spellbooks of Calm Monster, wishes results in 
[Nothing Happens.]

Emperor Moloch - [A voice in your head whispers hateful words... "*You'll have to come!*" 
                  "Maybe my friends can get you moving!" Suddenly several figures appear 
                  out of nowhere!] The several (about 20 - 25) figures are hostile greater 
                  molochs.

Quickling Bard - [A voice in your head giggles... 
                  "Nahfriendthiswayyouwontfindmeyoullhavetobemorepatient!" 
                  "Meetsomecompanionsofmineinthemeantime!" Suddenly several figures appear 
                  out of nowhere!] The several figures are all hostile quickling lords, 
                  which are considered summoned and therefore cannot be sacrificed.

Glod - [A strange little dwarf appears.] Described as "Glod, the small dwarf." Digs.

PC's name, Kranach, Ancient Chaos Wyrm, Snake From Beyond, Master Summoner, Yulgash, 
Ancient Stone Beast, Chaos Archmage, Nuurag-Vaarn, Ancient blue wyrm, Sharad-Waador, Filk, 
Assassin Prince, Keriax, sheriff, crime lord, Hotzenplotz, Grunge, Munge, Gaab'Baay, 
Hawkslayer, water dragon, baby water dragon, great water dragon, Blup, Shyssiryxius, 
healer, Jharod, mad carpenter, Yrrigs, black druid, Keethrax, master necromancer, Nonnak, 
Griff Bloodax, undead dwarven chaos berserker, mad doctor, nefarious doctor, Kranf Niest, 
ogre guardian, arena master, Waldenbrook, Garth, Rynt, Guth'Alak, priest, Munxip, 
Thrundarr, Mad Minstrel, Kherab, dwarven artificer, MaLaKaI, Fistanarius, cat lord - 
[Nothing Happens.]

raider lord, old barbarian, ratling guardian, dwarven mystic, cute dog - 
[Suddenly a -foo- appears!]

ratling trader or trader - A ratling trader, usually stocked.

shopkeeper - [You hear a voice in your mind... "Boys, get him/her!"] Thugs are summoned.

Wishing for a raider lord and killing him before Tywat Pare assigns the quest results in 
no reward from Tywat Pare, other than the 300 gold pieces for the corpse. Furthermore, he 
will not assign the quest. If the PC gets the quest, wishes for a raider lord and kills 
him, Tywat Pare acknowledges the kill and gives the usual reward.

Interestingly, wished-for ratling guardians are as immobile as those in the HMV and 
respond with the same message about guarding the city when 'C'hatted with.

Wished-for ancient karmic wyrms are similarly confused. They are immobile, think they are 
Sharad-Waador and ask the PC to "Stand on the stairs... then we'll talk."

A wished-for dwarven mystic always responds with the "Ye art doomed!" message and then 
disappears when 'C'hatted with. The PC is not in fact doomed. See section 2.5.4.

If the PC has received the puppy quest from the tiny girl, wishing for a cute dog and 
delivering it to her satisfies the quest requirement. If the PC has *not* received the 
quest, wishing for a cute dog may well result in one that is hostile. This causes an 
amusing scenario, to say the least, in Terinyo.


6-N  Appendix N - Differences in the various versions of ADOM

This list is much more detailed for the versions since 0.9.9 gamma 
six.  A really complete and really long list of all the changes 
made to ADOM since its inception can be found at Thomas Biskup's 
official site.  The full URL is:

http://www.adom.de/adom/history.php3


VERSION         NOTES
-------         -----

0.2.0          - first alpha version; only one dungeon; unwinnable

0.4.0          - Dwarftown, shops, herbs, pools added; 
                 first winnable version

0.7.0          - first public release; color added

0.9.0          - the game as it appears today comes into existence 
                 with a wilderness; ToEF added

0.9.9 gamma 6  - no mana temple; chaos god ending was possible;
                 no class powers; no Assassins' Guild; last gamma 
                 where RotHK dungeon was a single level; stat 
                 increases with herbs were unlimited

0.9.9 gamma 7  - suffered from a fatal bug in the mana temple, 
                 all walls were undiggable, mindcrafters could 
                 still win by teleporting in with their class 
                 power; class powers introduced

0.9.9 gamma 8  - regarded as a very easy version; several new 
                 artifacts; last gamma where drakelings became 
                 permanently fast from heat

0.9.9 gamma 9  - very difficult version: less item generation, 
                 more item destruction, first version where dropped 
                 items were destroyed by ranged spells, elemental 
                 orbs corrupted merely by carrying; necromancer 
                 display bug when creating slaves; first yellow 
                 pyramid and color-changing top level of ToEF

0.9.9 gamma 10 - extensively pretested which made this quite stable 
                 and balanced; first version where TotRR was 
                 available; vortices introduced; crumpled scroll, 
                 emperor moloch and quickling bard could be wished 
                 for; first implementation of wand of destruction 
                 ending; ultra endings were not possible because of 
                 requirement to wield both Sceptre and Trident at 
                 gate entry - Trident is two-handed!; game would 
                 sometimes crash unrecoverably upon entering the ID 
                 level containing Filk

0.9.9 gamma 11 - firing autotargeted missiles without selecting a 
                 target crashed the game

0.9.9 gamma 12 - stable; suffered from annoying bug that made many 
                 +0 items possible; last gamma where the & symbol 
                 was used for necklaces

0.9.9 gamma 13 - piety loss (much too high) and preferred sacrifices 
                 introduced; equipment destruction was ridiculous in 
                 this gamma; rivers introduced; room effects 
                 introduced; new room connection algorithm made some 
                 levels unplayable; short-lived

0.9.9 gamma 14 - piety loss still too high; room connection 
                 algorithm fixed

0.9.9 gamma 15 - first attempt at monster inventories: monsters 
                 which picked up items would not necessarily 
                 drop them when killed - including artifacts 
                 like the Chaos Orbs; +0 bug since gamma 12 
                 solved; piety loss toned down again

0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 1 - no entering dungeons?

0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 2 - bugs include a duplicate artifact 
                 bug and a strange (integer overflow?) bug that 
                 causes weird items (most often daggers with 
                 outrageous stats that cannot be picked up) and 
                 monsters that deal thousands of points of damage 
                 in a single hit - a very rare bug that does not 
                 make the game unplayable; there is also a duplicating 
                 missiles bug 

1.0.0          - released to the public August 6th, 2001; added item 
                 prefixes and suffixes; added a new wilderness location, 
                 the bug infested temple; removed possibility of 
                 teleportation in elemental temples

1.1.1          - released to the public November 20th, 2002; bug fix for 
                 1.1.0; bugs encountered so far: signal 291; extended drop 
                 can crash the game; "no mortal monster" bug; other problems: 
                 monsters gain experience too quickly, jackals are a prime example  


6-O  Appendix O - Abbreviations commonly used when discussing ADOM


These abbreviations are commonly used on the newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.adom.
Many of them are used in these documents as well.  They are used partly to protect 
new players from spoilers and partly for speed.

In general, a leading P for potion might be replaced by ! for potion.
Likewise a leading S for scroll might be replaced by ? for scroll and 
a leading W might be replaced by \ for wand.  In general, artifacts, 
locations and NPCs are capitalized in the description.

ADDENDUM: Challenge games

While not strictly part of the Guidebook, these are fun to think about nonetheless:


Not hard enough? - challenge games


Metalman games


Eternium man

A challenge game that has very simple rules. The PC must proceed directly from the 
starting point to the Small Cave. Ideally no wilderness encounters will occur along 
the way. The PC must stay in the Small Cave until experience level 50 is achieved.

This challenge game has never been completed. Whether it is possible is a matter of 
debate.


Ironman

The Ironman challenge is very, very difficult to complete. The PC must travel from 
the starting point in the Drakalor Chain to the Infinite Dungeon immediately. 
Stopping in Terinyo or anywhere else is not allowed. Wilderness encounters on the 
way to the infinite dungeon are allowed in principle, although ideally they should 
not occur.

The PC enters the Infinite Dungeon immediately upon arriving at the appropriate 
wilderness square. The PC must descend to the next level of the Infinite Dungeon 
every time a down staircase is found. No delay is allowed for any reason.

The objective is to retrieve the Sceptre of Chaos from the SIL, return to the 
surface and leave the Drakalor Chain. It is not necessary to kill MaLaKaI to do 
this, although in practice it may be unavoidable.

This challenge game has been successfully completed perhaps ten times by various 
players.


Lithium man

Lithium is the simplest possible metal. The simplest possible ADOM game would be to 
travel immediately to the CoC, visit the ToEF when necessary and finish the game. 
No other locations can be visited.

This challenge game has been completed about ten times by various players.


Plutonium Man

Plutonium is the most complex metal that occurs naturally. One possible version of 
the most complex ADOM game possible would be to kill at least one of every monster 
in the game. This is impossible, since some monsters are mutually exclusive, for 
instance Gaab'Baay vs Andor Drakon, Jharod and Yrrigs vs Keethrax. So in practice 
the objective of this game would be to kill as many different types of monsters as 
possible. Bear in mind that some monsters are exceptionally rare, such as solars, 
ki-rins and eternium golems and may have to be wished for. Finding and killing all 
great -color- wyrms would also quite likely be a significant challenge.

Rachel Walmsley came up with the idea for this challenge game and notes some 
interesting consequences:

* killing a cute dog and a raider lord and still going through the SMC
* having to take on more or less all the subquests available, including the 
  minotaur maze and the pyramid (with their level restrictions)
* killing Andor Drakon (or Gaab'Baay), Filk, the Emperor Moloch, etc.
* killing at least one eternal guardian
* taking on the demented ratling after feeding him artifacts
* having to waste a RoDS on a djinni to kill

It would probably be easiest to forfeit Andor Drakon, finish a normal game, thus 
stopping background corruption, and finish the game with an unlimited amount of 
time to accomplish the goal.

There are undoubtedly other implications.

Petri Sihvola shocked the entire ADOM community by completing the first example of 
this challenge game on March 15th, 2002. ;-) His PC killed at least one example of 
every monster available in the game with the exception of Andor Drakon and 
Keethrax, which are mutually exclusive with Gaab'Baay and Yrrigs + Jharod, 
respectively. Petri used the technique outlined above, closing the chaos gate as 
soon as feasible, then finishing the game. Eleven wishes for rare monsters were 
used which required a marathon session in the blue dragon caves after the gate was 
closed. A total of 3802 ancient blue dragons were killed.

Markku Rikola posted a UCG Plutonium Man entry March 20th, 2002. The monsters which 
escaped this PC were: Gaab'Baay (of course), Keethrax (the PC chose to slay Yrrigs 
and Jharod), ancient karmic dragon, emperor lich, fairy dragon, frost giant jarl, 
great black wyrm, great white wyrm, greater mimic and small dwarf.


Steel Man

Again, very simple. Enter the wilderness and do not leave it until the PC is 
experience level 50 (optionally never eat the food the PC starts with). Entering 
any game locations is not allowed. The first example of this challenge game was 
posted January 20th, 2004 by Alex Pinachos. Extreme tactics were required.


Titanium Man

The objective here is to finish the game with the lowest experience level character 
possible. The Chaos Gate must be closed. Trolls have an obvious advantage, and 
should be considered separately for this challenge game. Alex Pinachos comlpeted 
the first example of this game on February 3rd, 2004, with an "ordinary" chaos god 
ending. The only monster the PC killed was Andor Drakon, who is worth only one 
experience point. The PC ended the game at experience level one, with 87 total 
experience points.


Other challenge-man games

(credit Malte Helmert)


Pacifist Man

Win the game while killing as few monsters as possible. The total number of kills 
in the kill list counts (the lower, the better).


Ecological Balance Man

Win the game while avoiding to kill many monsters of the same type. The maximum of 
all numbers in the kill list counts (the lower, the better).


Mediocre Man

Win the game with low attribute values. The highest attribute value (as displayed 
on the screen, i.e. including items, boosts and corruptions) ever encountered 
during the game counts (the lower, the better). Exception: If a stat is raised by a 
corruption and that corruption is removed on the turn after the character obtains 
it, the higher value does not count.


Restricted Games


Players have completed the game with a variety of different restrictions, for a 
challenge, to demonstrate that it is possible, or to point out a game feature that 
they regard as abusable or flawed.

Restricted games can involve almost anything: methods of attack, equipment used and 
religious attitude among others. The game can be completed without using the 
ratling traders as a food source. It can be completed without using the food the PC 
starts with and never buying from Munxip. It can be completed without eating any 
corpses. Never buy from shops. Kill every shopkeeper. The list is infinite...


Restricted attack games


The game has been completed using offensive attacks limited to: only magic, only 
thrown rocks, only unarmed fighting and only kicking. A game has also been 
completed where all missile and melee weapon skills were equally developed.


Restricted equipment games


Brass Man

Markku Rikola has completed the game with a PC who picked up no artifacts other 
than the chaos orbs and never used them. The PC was crowned; sixteen artifacts were 
generated during the entire game.

Steven desJardins improved upon this: He completed a game (June 2002) in which only 
the seven required artifacts (the si, Moon Sickle and the Chaos Orbs) and Whirlwind 
(randomly generated in the Casino) were generated. The artifacts were never used.


Proton Man

Petri Sihvola has completed the game (December 2001) without ever equipping any 
items. This means no armor can be worn, no missile or melee weapons can be wielded, 
no tools can be equipped and no chaos orbs can be used in the tool slot.


Carbon Fiber Man

Malte Helmert has completed the game with the most severe equipment restriction 
posssible - only 100s of inventory can be carried at any given time. This is the 
ultimate restriction possible since the Chaos Orbs themselves weigh 100s. This 
means the PC must be naked with no equipment or food when carrying a Chaos Orb. It 
also means the Chaos Orbs located above the Casino, the Fire and Water Orbs, must 
be brought past the Eternal Guardian one at a time without the Ring of the High 
Kings. Since climbing sets weigh 180s, the Tomb of the High Kings, the Rift and the 
Library are all inaccessible in this challenge game.

Upon first consideration, this game might seem impossible due to food 
considerations, but Malte reports that this was not a huge problem, although there 
were a few tense moments. The PC, a trollish monk, was careful to maintain high 
piety at all times in case of a food emergency. In addition, strategic caches of 
food, SoCRs, holy water and an amulet of death ray resistance among others were 
stored throughout the game, initially in Dwarftown then lower and lower for the 
dive into the CoC.

Malte reports the most significant problems in this challenge game were surviving 
the early game then getting the two early orbs and the PC's equipment past a 
hostile Eternal Guardian in stages.


Restricted tactics games

Many can be envisioned. The Atheist challenge is one where the PC does not 
acknowledge the existence of the gods, never asks for divine assistance and never 
uses an altar for any reason. A successful completion of this challenge game has 
been reported only once, by Griffin Knodle on April 14th, 2001. A more restrictive 
variant involves denying the existence of holy water. Holy (or unholy) water cannot 
be acknowledged or used for any reason. This challenge has also been completed only 
once, by Steven desJardins on October 27th, 2001.

Barbarians are an obvious choice for the Berserker challenge: never change Tactics 
from berserk, and optionally never wear body armor. This challenge game has been 
completed at least once with a dwarven barbarian.

Note that the PC has to be very careful during this challenge game. No messages 
along the lines of "Do you really want to attack the -foo-" will be generated. True 
berserkers simply do not receive this message. Be very careful about moving into a 
shopkeeper, for instance.
