# 3.3 The Casino

The Casino is found on D: 30 or D: 31. The layout is as follows:

```

```

The guaranteed monsters found here are casino guards (the @s outside the Great Gift 
Shoppe), a big casino guard (guarding the down staircase) and the shopkeeper (the @ 
inside the Great Gift Shoppe). The $s in the body of the Casino are not piles of gold, 
but rather slot machines. There will be a number of non-hostile monsters wandering 
about the Casino and the Great Gift Shoppe.

It is possible to win essentialy unlimited amounts of gold from the slot machines. 
Intrinsic Dooming, Cursing, Lucky and Fate Smiles have no effect. Wearing items that 
grant Luck (the hidden property) or the Lucky/Fate Smiles intrinsics make no difference. 
The fastest way to accumulate money is to choose a machine that costs 24 gold pieces to 
play and 'h'andle the lever. Place a heavy object on the spacebar of your keyboard. 
Check back after five minutes or so by picking up the gold on the floor. There should be 
quite a pile.

As long as the technique above is used - simply leaving the spacebar depressed - all of 
this gambling will take place during a single game turn, so the PC will not be spending 
hours of game time in the Casino getting corrupted. This is after all D: 30 or D: 31, 
moderately deep in the CoC. So resist the temptation to check on your winnings every 30 
seconds! ;-)

The payout from the slot machines follows a precise formula, shown below: 

Item              |  Two alike   |     Three alike
----              |  :---------:   |     -----------:
kobold            |       1x     |            1x
goblin            |       4x     |            8x
hobgoblin         |       9x     |           27x
gnoll             |      16x     |           64x
ogre              |      25x     |          125x
wizard            |      36x     |          216x 
ettin             |      49x     |          343x
giant             |      64x     |          512x
hero              |      81x     |          729x
treasure hoard    |     100x     |         1000x
magical wand      |     121x     |         1331x
magical ring      |     144x     |         1728x
magical weapon    |     169x     |         2197x
magical armor     |     196x     |         2744x
artifact          |     225x     |         3375x
ancient hero      |     256x     |         4096x
dragon            |     289x     |         4913x
ancient dragon    |     324x     |         5832x

As an example, two goblins results in a return of 4x the original bet, for a profit of 3x 
the original bet.  The average payout works out to approximately 24x the original bet.  
This has been verified empirically, and agrees with theory.

Be aware that if the PC uses the slot machines, the Big Casino Guard will block the down 
staircase and expect the PC to spend his winnings - and more - in the Great Gift Shoppe, 
which is ridiculously overpriced. This problem can be solved by teleporting the Big Casino 
Guard. This transports him to another location on the level. He does not become hostile, 
does not move and behaves exactly as if he were still blocking the stairs (this is probably 
a bug).


## 3.3.1 Strategies for robbing the Casino

There are two monsters that are particularly tough on the level: the shopkeeper and the big 
casino guard. Their vital statistics:

* Big casino guard: You examine the big casino guard. Diagnosis: Level: 2, DV: 19, PV: 24, Hits: 307, Attacks: 2, Damage: 17-72. Speed: 106.
* Shopkeeper: You examine Orgovek, the human shopkeeper. Diagnosis: Level: 11, DV: 10, PV: 20, Hits: 926, Attacks: 6, Damage: 21-36. Speed: 195.

These stats do not change after the monsters become hostile.

The key event in robbing the Casino is causing the monsters on the level to become hostile, 
whether or not the PC has actually picked up anything from the Great Gift Shoppe. There are 
a number of events that will cause the monsters to become hostile, including attacking the 
guards or the shopkeeper and zapping a wand of destruction that damages any of the guards 
or the walls of the Great Gift Shoppe. Once the monsters become hostile, a number of things 
happen. First, the number of guards on the level approximately triples. They cluster around 
both the up and down staircases and are plentiful elsewhere. Second, the teleportation 
restrictions inside the Great Gift Shoppe cease. This means the PC is free to teleport to 
any location on the level, but since the up and down staircases will be blocked by guards, 
it is not possible to teleport to these locations and leave the level.

Invisibility is strange on the level. The casino guards and the big casino guard see 
invisible. The shopkeeper welcomes an invisible PC when he enters the Great Gift Shoppe, 
but when an invisible PC picks up an item, the shopkeeper does not immediately block the 
door. The standard "shopkeeper stares at your position with great intensity" message must 
be generated before he blocks the door. However, the shopkeeper instantly sounds an alarm 
when an undetected invisible PC who has picked up an item leaves the Great Gift Shoppe. 
Despite this, the shopkeeper does not see the invisible PC as he flees through the body of 
the Casino.

None of the monsters on the level are able to see in darkness. However, some will still 
cluster around the PC in darkness, while others, including the big casino guard who 
ordinarily blocks the down staircase, will wander aimlessly. This means that if a PC needs 
to rest and recover hitpoints, or pray for healing, or drink healing potions, darkness is 
your friend. A PC can stand in one spot indefinitely in the dark. The tendency of the 
monsters to cluster around the PC or wander about also means they will leave the vicinity 
of the staircases. Thus a PC can rob the Casino, cast Darkness, wait, then teleport to the 
down staircase. This is risky, however, since if the PC is doomed by robbing the Casino 
(see below) there is a 1 in 1000 chance of an instadeath each turn from a grue attack (see 
section 0.13.4).

The stats for the shopkeeper above should make it clear that speed is critical when robbing 
the Casino. Anything that increases speed is valuable - rings of speed, speed boosting 
potions and especially seven league boots. It is possible to make the shopkeeper hostile by 
throwing missiles or zapping a spell at him, ideally from as far away as possible, then 
literally outrun him out of the Great Gift Shoppe. This is one way the Casino can be robbed 
without any spells whatsoever.

## 3.3.2 Consequences of robbing the Casino

The consequences of robbing the Casino vary according to a couple of factors. First is the 
alignment of the PC. Lawful PCs will likely be cursed and doomed. Neutral PCs will likely 
be cursed, perhaps doomed. Chaotics will probably get away with no cursing or dooming. 
Lawful and neutral PCs will move their alignment towards chaotic. This may or may not be 
visible on the main screen. It is known for PCs to be so lawful by this point in the game 
that their alignment does not vary from L+ despite robbing the Casino. The second factor is 
exactly what transpires during the robbery. Killing the shopkeeper in the process of 
robbing the Casino is not recommended for crowned champions of Law or Balance, of course. 
Attacking the guards on the way out or after dragging them down to the next level should 
not cause an alignment drop as they will be hostile at that point.

The cursing and/or dooming is obviously the biggest problem PCs face after robbing the 
Casino. Fortunately, there is a shortcut to the surface of the Drakalor Chain (see section 
3.5) available one or two levels below the Casino. This makes it possible to get to a 
coaligned altar near the surface quickly and sacrifice in order to get rid of the unwanted 
cursing or dooming, although it is possible at this point in the game that the player might 
want to exploit those intrinsics. In any case, remember where those coaligned altars are 
near the surface! If you plan to rob the Casino, they can be essential.
