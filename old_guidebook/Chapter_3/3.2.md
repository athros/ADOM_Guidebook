# 3.2 The Eternal Guardian

The Eternal Guardian is found one or two levels before the Casino. He guards the down 
staircase on the level. He only allows peaceful passage of PCs if they are wearing the Ring 
of the High Kings, obtainable from the Tomb of the High Kings (section 2.12). It is 
definitely possible to pass him without the ring, although it presents special problems. 
The obvious tactic of teleporting him away from the stairs does not work, as he is 
resistant to teleportation. Trying to kill him in melee or with missiles is more or less 
pointless, since he reincarnates even if the PC manages to kill him, which is very 
difficult. If a PC wants to pass him without the RotHK, it is best to make him angry such 
that he chases the PC, followed by a quick teleport to the down stairs and descent.

Note, however, that passing the Eternal Guardian without the Ring of the High Kings means 
that the shortcut to the surface through Darkforge (see section 3.4) will not work in the 
down direction - a distinct disadvantage.
