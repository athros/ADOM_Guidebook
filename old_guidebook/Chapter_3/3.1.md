# 3.1 The wall of flames

A wall of flames is encountered around D: 27. Even if the PC has fire immunity, it cannot 
be passed without the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. The Orb is found in the Tower of Eternal 
Flames. The wall of flames forces the player to retrieve it before proceeding. See section 
2.19 for more on the Tower of Eternal Flames.
