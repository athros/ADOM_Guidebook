The amulets with a numerical modifier above are base value in g16p2.  There 
are others available.  The numerical modifier can be {base value} +/- 3.  
Amulets of speed, however, are always (+3 spd).  Extensive testing was done 
by wishing for amulets of the cold heart and amulets of defense.  For the 
statisticians among the readers, the results are shown below.  The PC had no 
amulets before this.  The test was done on PC: 1 with an experience level 
one PC who wished for the amulets 100 times.  

The results were as follows:

   A - heap of 215 uncursed amulets of the cold heart {Ch-12}           [645s]
   B - heap of 26 blessed amulets of the cold heart {Ch-12}              [78s]

   A - heap of 212 uncursed amulets of defense +2                       [636s]
   B - heap of 36 cursed amulets of defense +2                          [108s]

   G - heap of 2 uncursed amulets of defense +1                           [6s]

   K - heap of 2 amulets of defense +2                                    [6s]
   L - cursed amulet of defense +3                                        [3s]
   M - uncursed rusty amulet of defense +3                                [3s]
   N - heap of 2 uncursed amulets of defense +3                           [6s]
   O - heap of 2 uncursed amulets of defense +0                           [6s]
   L - uncursed amulet of defense -1                                      [3s]
   M - cursed amulet of defense +0                                        [3s]
   N - blessed amulet of defense +4                                       [3s]
   O - blessed amulet of defense +3                                       [3s]

The results may conceivably vary depending on the danger level of the dungeon 
or the blessed/uncursed/cursed status of the wand of wishing.  This will be 
investigated in the future.  The wand used for these tests was uncursed.

A couple of days after this was all figured out, a level 50 PC on D: 50 found 
an amulet of the cold heart {Ch-16}.  It was dropped by a great wyrm.  So it 
seems that the +/- 3 is only a very good guide to amulets, not an ironclad rule.

Thanks to ToGu for contributing the odds of obtaining weapons with a prefix, suffix or both:

Prefixes and suffixes are evenly distributed.
4/6 of items have a chance to have a prefix.
4/6 of items have a chance to have a suffix.
2/6 of items have a chance to have both a prefix and a suffix.

The chance to actually get the prefix/suffix is then 1/(10-(LEVEL/10))

For a L50 character this means:
Prefix: (4/6)/(10-(50/10)) = 2/15 = 13.3333%
Suffix: (4/6)/(10-(50/10)) = 2/15 = 13.3333%
Both: (2/6)/(10-(50/10))/(10-(50/10)) = 1/75 = 1.3333%

Fo a L1 character this means:
Prefix: (4/6)/(10-(1/10)) = 2/30 = 6.6667%
Suffix: (4/6)/(10-(1/10)) = 2/30 = 6.6667%
Both: (2/6)/(10-(1/10))/(10-(1/10)) = 1/300 = 0.3333%

[1] Scrolls of defense and protection affect only the following worn items in this order: armor, helmet, cloak, boots, gauntlets, 
girdle, bracers. Cursed SoD and SoP always decrease DV or PV by one. Blessed SoD and SoP may increase items with low DV or PV by 
two or three points.

Scrolls can be written if the PC is literate, has seen an example of the scroll, 
has a magical writing set and a blank scroll to write on. Blank scrolls can be 
found in the dungeons (an unlabeled scroll), or they can be created by dipping 
other scrolls into *normal* water - not holy water or unholy water. Be aware that 
the cost for writing scrolls of chaos resistance is high - there is a permanent 
loss of two or three mana points for *wizards*, apparently depending on the blessed 
vs uncursed status of the magical writing set.  The mana cost for non-wizards is 
significantly higher, ten mana points is typical.  In addition, any combination of 
a blessed MWS with an uncursed blank scroll or an uncursed MWS with a blessed or 
uncursed blank scroll will result in a loss of hitpoints.  This loss ranged from 
70 to 145 HP with a WADOMF'd experience level one wizard PC.  The HP loss may go 
down with increasing experience level for wizards, but this has not been tested.  
The HP consequences for non-wizards may be more dramatic (i.e. deadly).

Writing other scrolls does not have such drastic consequences, though the exact 
effects have yet to be worked out.


6-G  Appendix G - Food - complete list


Thanks to Malte Helmert for working out all details of this Appendix

Most "base" PCs use one unit of nutrition each turn. The units of nutrition 
for the various food items are listed below. None of the following applies 
to food consumption in the big wilderness map, where different rules apply 
(maybe just a multiplier).

Apart from equipment, the formula for a PC's food consumption per turn is
as follows:

 1 is standard
+1 for Trolls
+1 when Strained or Strained!
+2 when Overburdened!

The total value after those modifiers is halved for Farmers of Level 12+
and monks of any level. So, for example, an overburdened human fighter
would consume 3 units per turn, and a strained! troll monk would consume
1.5 units per turn. In this case, fractions are *not* rounded away: The
character will alternate between consuming 1 and 2 units.

After that, additional modifiers apply, which are *not* halved for monks
or farmers:

+3    for each (!) equipped item granting Invisibility
+0.5  for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for uncrowned or fallen 
       champion PCs
+0.25 for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for crowned PCs
+15   in the wilderness, for non-Trolls
+30   in the wilderness, for Trolls
          

Food consumption in the wilderness is independent of movement speed, 
including seven league boots, and terrain type.

So, for example, a strained troll barbarian, crowned chaotic, wearing 7 
artifacts and one item granting Invisibility will consume 7 units per turn 
(1 standard, 1 troll, 1 strained, 7/4 rounded down = 1 for the artifacts, 
3 for the invisibility).

From all experiments conducted with WADOMF and g16pre2, there was no 
influence caused by:

* alignment (some suggested that only champions of law get the artifact 
             discount, but it is identical for chaotics and presumably
             neutrals)

* being a fallen champion (that is, there is no special penalty - it's
                           just like not being crowned)

* any corruption (the suspicious mana battery and corrupted
                  tissue corruptions were tested)

* any intrinsic (particularly, intrinsic invisiblity does not increase
                 food consumption - this was very surprising; likewise, 
                 the doomed/cursed/lucky/having Fate smile makes no 
                 difference

* the invisibility spell

* being a Healer or being born in the month of Candle

* HP or PP regeneration rate, having eaten Troll corpses, having drunk
  potions of troll blood or raw mana, wielding regenerating items - the
  last is very surprising


The different satiation categories are:

satiation level  2501+      : bloated
satiation level  1501..2500 : satiated
satiation level  200..1500  : normal
satiation level  100..199   : hungry
satiation level  50..99     : very hungry
satiation level  0..49      : starving

A character with satiation level 0 has a random chance of dying because
of starvation each turn. In g16p2 and later versions, apparently no food 
consumption takes place while eating, so it should be impossible to starve 
to death while eating (unlike previous versions).

stomacemptia             2s      see below     1     eaten, reduces satiation (worst when cursed)
stomafillia              2s      see below     1     eaten, increases satiation (best when blessed)

The satiation value is increased by 25% for blessed items and decreased by 50% for cursed items.

KEY: 1 - unidentified appear as strange herb; can be identified by picking with the Herbalism skill
     2 - susceptible to rotting
     3 - unidentified appear as bit of candy; 
         can be identified by taste: plain = 'sweet', gnomish = 'annoyingly sweet'; 
         children will only accept plain candy
     4 - unidentified appear as seed
     5 - more nutritious for dark elves: cursed = 2010, uncursed =  1020, blessed = 125; 
         this unusual fact is in fact intentional
     6 - more nutritious for orcs (2X), trolls (3X), barbarians (3X) and beastfighters (3X); 
         if a PC falls into more than one category, only the higher bonus applies - i.e. 
         orcish beastfighters are 3X; drakelings receive a different message than other races 
         but get the usual 500 satiation points
     7 - Fried fish meat indeed has a fractional weight. If a stack of fried fish meat contains 
         an odd number of pieces, the weight of the stack is rounded up

Stomafillia herbs are different in that their b/u/c status is more
influential than for other food items: They yield 6250/2000/550 points of 
satiation depending on whether they are blessed, uncursed or cursed.

Stomacemptia herbs are the only non-corpse food items that lower the
satiation level. Even bad ratling food, despite yielding the "you vomit" 
message, satiates slightly. Stomacemptia herbs do not apply a fixed 
modifier but behave a bit differently:

If the character is not yet starving, the new satiation level is set to a 
fixed value depending on the b/u/c status of the herb (rows) and the old 
satiation value (columns):

          50..99     100..199   200..1500  1501+

blessed   49         99         199        1500
uncursed  49         49         99         199
cursed    49         49         49         49

Put in words, blessed herbs always set the satiation level to the highest 
possible value of the next lower category (from satiated to normal, from 
normal to hungry, from hungry to very hungry, from very hungry to 
starving), uncursed herbs go two such steps, and cursed herbs always go 
down to starving.

If the character is already starving (satiation value 0..49), then the
satiation value is decreased by 20, but not below 0, irrespective of b/u/c 
status of the herb.

It is possible to wish for "satiation" or "food". This sets the satiation 
level to 5000 if it was below this value. It does nothing otherwise.

Scrolls of satiation add 2000/1000/0 to the satiation level
if blessed/uncursed/cursed.

Apart from corpses, the only food items that can be cooked are raw meat 
and fish meat, as noted in the table. Unlike corpses, they can only be 
cooked with the cooking skill; fire destroys them.

From preliminary testing, it seems that apples and pieces of raw meat rot 
at approximately the same rate.

6-J  Appendix J - Monsters - complete list

This list is formulated as follows:

Monster name (unique name) - alignment (C, N or L)
Symbol
Special attacks and defenses
Corpse effects
Misc


Orb guardians are listed first.  The remainder of the monsters are listed 
alphabetically by name (not symbol).  The alphabetical listings are separated 
by triple letters corresponding to the first letter of the monster's name.  

For example, to search for a monster name that begins with G that you are 
uncertain of, search for GGG with your text editor and browse the list.  

Obviously, this list cannot be as explicit as the web site, since specific 
colors for those monsters that are represented by the same symbol in various 
colors cannot be specifically represented.

of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d4 
points of damage.

(see section 2.4 for more about the si)


-------------------------------- silver key --------------------------------

Weight: 1s

When used in melee combat it grants a -8 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -8 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

(and it will unlock all doors and bypass all door traps, even if cursed)



6-M  Appendix M - Wishing - suggestions


Wishing suggestions: naturally, any useful non-artifact item: amulet of life saving (if 
striving for an ultra ending), pairs of seven league boots ("pairs of" guarantees plurality), 
whips of the snake, phase daggers, swords of sharpness, maces of destruction (although Big 
Punch should be around already), eternium tower shields, eternium plate mails, eternium 
-weapon of choice-s, -color- dragon scale mail, rings of elemental mastery, and of course, 
scrolls of chaos resistance, as they work better than potions of cure corruption.

Also, wishes can yield any skill except for Alertness (which, when wished for, increases 
Perception) and Healing (which, when wished for, heals the PC). Stats can also be wished 
for - although, wishing for 'learning' yields potions of learning - wish for 'knowledge' 
to increase Learning directly.  Appearance has to be wished for as 'beauty' and Perception 
as 'alertness'. The size of the stat increase depends on the stat: 7 points of Willpower is 
possible, the Strength bonus is usually around 3 and as high as 5 - which makes it more 
worthwhile to wish for potions of strength instead.

A "manual of bridge building" can be wished for and the PC is able to learn 
the skill by reading it.  Wishing for "manuals of bridge building" results 
in the strange flux message then Nothing Happens.

If the PC wants to increase Learning, wishing for crystals of knowledge is better than 
wishing for potions of learning since blessed CoK's increase Learning by 1d2, you get 
three with one wish, and you can bless multiple CoK's with one potion of holy water, 
whereas you get two potions of learning, both of which take a potion of holy water to 
bless. With any decent kind of luck, the CoK's should bring at least 4, 5 or even 6 extra 
points to Learning.

Wishing for 'corruption' results in a corruptor.

Wishing for 'death' results in unnatural aging (76 years reproducibly with one human PC, 
this may be race and age dependent).

Wishing for 'invisibility' results in rings of invisibility.

Wishing for the plural form of certain items results in a message:

A voice in your mind booms...
"*ONE* SHALL BE ENOUGH!"
Your equipment feels heavier.

Items in this category include amulets of life saving, girdles of giant strength and 
potions of gain attributes. Certain other items can only be obtained two at a time. 
Examples include potions of -stat-.


Wishing for speed:

Stephen White has studied this in some detail and posted the following to RGRA on 
March 7th, 2002: 

> First I will mention that during the following testing I was
> careful to look out for things like base modification of
> speed due to burden or hunger status - I was always not even
> burdened, and always of no specific hunger status, i.e. not
> satiated or hungry, just normal.

> OK, I just tested this out. I wished for "potions of boost speed"
> 10 times. I got only two potions twice, three potions six times,
> and four potions twice, so we can assume the average is three
> per wish.

> I blessed them all, and drank them one at a time, allowing my
> speed to return to normal between each one. The lowest speed
> boost given was 21 points, which occured three times. The
> highest was 47, acheived just once. The average overall was
> 30.8 speed points from one blessed potion.

> This gives an overall total (assuming three potions from an
> average wish, and average gain from each) of 92.4 points.

> Then I tried wishing for "speed" directly, 12 times. I let my
> speed return to normal after each, and took account of the
> permanent increase of 1 point left over after the boost wears
> off. The minimum boost I received was 150 points, the maximum
> was 248 points. The overall average was 214.2 points.

> So, this is pretty conclusive - it's best to wish for "speed"
> directly. It's *possible* to gain more by using potions, if
> you get 4 from your wish, and a decent gain from each, compared
> to a quite unlucky wish for "speed", but in general wishing
> for speed directly is almost guaranteed to give the bigger
> increase.

The original context of the thread was in regard to techniques useful when fighting 
Andor Drakon. High speed is also useful when fighting Srraxxarrakex, the emperor 
moloch, or other monsters the PC just doesn't want to be hit by.


Results from some unusual wishes:

The game's direct response is [in square brackets].

babes - ["We are feeling lonely, aren't we?"]

crumpled scroll - Wishing for 'crumpled scroll' results in a blank scroll.

friends - [A telepathic voice sounds in your head: "Thou shalt have a friend!". 
          A -foo- appears!] A tame animal pet or a companion.

immortality - ["Funny, very funny."]

moloch armor - Wishing for moloch armor results in eternium plate mail.

money or gold - [Suddenly gold pieces rain down upon you!] About 43,000 gold pieces.

sheep - The parser interprets this as a wish for a banshee.  Be prepared.<p>

Thomas Biskup - [A voice booms... "*Thou shalt not mock the Creator*!"]

Underwater creatures - wishing for a giant eel or a shark or dragon turtle
while not in Shyssiryxius' cave, results in [A tiny red herring appears for a few seconds...]<p>

If underwater creatures are wished for when surrounded by water (in the middle of a river, the
Terinyo island, etc), the game responds with [For some seconds a ghostly figure seems to appear,
 but then it dissipates once more.]<p>

Wishing for underwater creatures in Shyssiryxius' cave results in the creatures as normal.<p>

wands of wishing, rings of djinni summoning, spellbooks of Wish, wishes, etc: Wishing for 
wands of wishing results in a wand of wonder; rings of djinni summoning results in brass 
rings, spellbooks of Wish results in spellbooks of Calm Monster, wishes results in 
[Nothing Happens.]

Emperor Moloch - [A voice in your head whispers hateful words... "*You'll have to come!*" 
                  "Maybe my friends can get you moving!" Suddenly several figures appear 
                  out of nowhere!] The several (about 20 - 25) figures are hostile greater 
                  molochs.

Quickling Bard - [A voice in your head giggles... 
                  "Nahfriendthiswayyouwontfindmeyoullhavetobemorepatient!" 
                  "Meetsomecompanionsofmineinthemeantime!" Suddenly several figures appear 
                  out of nowhere!] The several figures are all hostile quickling lords, 
                  which are considered summoned and therefore cannot be sacrificed.

Glod - [A strange little dwarf appears.] Described as "Glod, the small dwarf." Digs.

PC's name, Kranach, Ancient Chaos Wyrm, Snake From Beyond, Master Summoner, Yulgash,

raider lord, old barbarian, ratling guardian, dwarven mystic, cute dog - 
[Suddenly a -foo- appears!]

ratling trader or trader - A ratling trader, usually stocked.

shopkeeper - [You hear a voice in your mind... "Boys, get him/her!"] Thugs are summoned.

Wishing for a raider lord and killing him before Tywat Pare assigns the quest results in 
no reward from Tywat Pare, other than the 300 gold pieces for the corpse. Furthermore, he 
will not assign the quest. If the PC gets the quest, wishes for a raider lord and kills 
him, Tywat Pare acknowledges the kill and gives the usual reward.

Interestingly, wished-for ratling guardians are as immobile as those in the HMV and 
respond with the same message about guarding the city when 'C'hatted with.

Wished-for ancient karmic wyrms are similarly confused. They are immobile, think they are 
Sharad-Waador and ask the PC to "Stand on the stairs... then we'll talk."

A wished-for dwarven mystic always responds with the "Ye art doomed!" message and then 
disappears when 'C'hatted with. The PC is not in fact doomed. See section 2.5.4.

If the PC has received the puppy quest from the tiny girl, wishing for a cute dog and 
delivering it to her satisfies the quest requirement. If the PC has *not* received the 
quest, wishing for a cute dog may well result in one that is hostile. This causes an 
amusing scenario, to say the least, in Terinyo.


6-N  Appendix N - Differences in the various versions of ADOM

This list is much more detailed for the versions since 0.9.9 gamma 
six.  A really complete and really long list of all the changes 
made to ADOM since its inception can be found at Thomas Biskup's 
official site.  The full URL is:

http://www.adom.de/adom/history.php3


VERSION         NOTES
-------         -----

0.2.0          - first alpha version; only one dungeon; unwinnable

0.4.0          - Dwarftown, shops, herbs, pools added; 
                 first winnable version

0.7.0          - first public release; color added

0.9.0          - the game as it appears today comes into existence 
                 with a wilderness; ToEF added

0.9.9 gamma 6  - no mana temple; chaos god ending was possible;
                 no class powers; no Assassins' Guild; last gamma 
                 where RotHK dungeon was a single level; stat 
                 increases with herbs were unlimited

0.9.9 gamma 7  - suffered from a fatal bug in the mana temple, 
                 all walls were undiggable, mindcrafters could 
                 still win by teleporting in with their class 
                 power; class powers introduced

0.9.9 gamma 8  - regarded as a very easy version; several new 
                 artifacts; last gamma where drakelings became 
                 permanently fast from heat

0.9.9 gamma 9  - very difficult version: less item generation, 
                 more item destruction, first version where dropped 
                 items were destroyed by ranged spells, elemental 
                 orbs corrupted merely by carrying; necromancer 
                 display bug when creating slaves; first yellow 
                 pyramid and color-changing top level of ToEF

0.9.9 gamma 10 - extensively pretested which made this quite stable 
                 and balanced; first version where TotRR was 
                 available; vortices introduced; crumpled scroll, 
                 emperor moloch and quickling bard could be wished 
                 for; first implementation of wand of destruction 
                 ending; ultra endings were not possible because of 
                 requirement to wield both Sceptre and Trident at 
                 gate entry - Trident is two-handed!; game would 
                 sometimes crash unrecoverably upon entering the ID 
                 level containing Filk

0.9.9 gamma 11 - firing autotargeted missiles without selecting a 
                 target crashed the game

0.9.9 gamma 12 - stable; suffered from annoying bug that made many 
                 +0 items possible; last gamma where the & symbol 
                 was used for necklaces

0.9.9 gamma 13 - piety loss (much too high) and preferred sacrifices 
                 introduced; equipment destruction was ridiculous in 
                 this gamma; rivers introduced; room effects 
                 introduced; new room connection algorithm made some 
                 levels unplayable; short-lived

0.9.9 gamma 14 - piety loss still too high; room connection 
                 algorithm fixed

0.9.9 gamma 15 - first attempt at monster inventories: monsters 
                 which picked up items would not necessarily 
                 drop them when killed - including artifacts 
                 like the Chaos Orbs; +0 bug since gamma 12 
                 solved; piety loss toned down again

0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 1 - no entering dungeons?

0.9.9 gamma 16 - prerelease 2 - bugs include a duplicate artifact 
                 bug and a strange (integer overflow?) bug that 
                 causes weird items (most often daggers with 
                 outrageous stats that cannot be picked up) and 
                 monsters that deal thousands of points of damage 
                 in a single hit - a very rare bug that does not 
                 make the game unplayable; there is also a duplicating 
                 missiles bug 

1.0.0          - released to the public August 6th, 2001; added item 
                 prefixes and suffixes; added a new wilderness location, 
                 the bug infested temple; removed possibility of 
                 teleportation in elemental temples

1.1.1          - released to the public November 20th, 2002; bug fix for 
                 1.1.0; bugs encountered so far: signal 291; extended drop 
                 can crash the game; "no mortal monster" bug; other problems: 
                 monsters gain experience too quickly, jackals are a prime example

ADDENDUM: Challenge games

While not strictly part of the Guidebook, these are fun to think about nonetheless:


Not hard enough? - challenge games


Metalman games


Eternium man

A challenge game that has very simple rules. The PC must proceed directly from the 
starting point to the Small Cave. Ideally no wilderness encounters will occur along 
the way. The PC must stay in the Small Cave until experience level 50 is achieved.

This challenge game has never been completed. Whether it is possible is a matter of 
debate.


Ironman

The Ironman challenge is very, very difficult to complete. The PC must travel from 
the starting point in the Drakalor Chain to the Infinite Dungeon immediately. 
Stopping in Terinyo or anywhere else is not allowed. Wilderness encounters on the 
way to the infinite dungeon are allowed in principle, although ideally they should 
not occur.

The PC enters the Infinite Dungeon immediately upon arriving at the appropriate 
wilderness square. The PC must descend to the next level of the Infinite Dungeon 
every time a down staircase is found. No delay is allowed for any reason.

The objective is to retrieve the Sceptre of Chaos from the SIL, return to the 
surface and leave the Drakalor Chain. It is not necessary to kill MaLaKaI to do 
this, although in practice it may be unavoidable.

This challenge game has been successfully completed perhaps ten times by various 
players.


Lithium man

Lithium is the simplest possible metal. The simplest possible ADOM game would be to 
travel immediately to the CoC, visit the ToEF when necessary and finish the game. 
No other locations can be visited.

This challenge game has been completed about ten times by various players.


Plutonium Man

Plutonium is the most complex metal that occurs naturally. One possible version of 
the most complex ADOM game possible would be to kill at least one of every monster 
in the game. This is impossible, since some monsters are mutually exclusive, for 
instance Gaab'Baay vs Andor Drakon, Jharod and Yrrigs vs Keethrax. So in practice 
the objective of this game would be to kill as many different types of monsters as 
possible. Bear in mind that some monsters are exceptionally rare, such as solars, 
ki-rins and eternium golems and may have to be wished for. Finding and killing all 
great -color- wyrms would also quite likely be a significant challenge.

Rachel Walmsley came up with the idea for this challenge game and notes some 
interesting consequences:

* killing a cute dog and a raider lord and still going through the SMC
* having to take on more or less all the subquests available, including the 
  minotaur maze and the pyramid (with their level restrictions)
* killing Andor Drakon (or Gaab'Baay), Filk, the Emperor Moloch, etc.
* killing at least one eternal guardian
* taking on the demented ratling after feeding him artifacts
* having to waste a RoDS on a djinni to kill

It would probably be easiest to forfeit Andor Drakon, finish a normal game, thus 
stopping background corruption, and finish the game with an unlimited amount of 
time to accomplish the goal.

There are undoubtedly other implications.

Petri Sihvola shocked the entire ADOM community by completing the first example of 
this challenge game on March 15th, 2002. ;-) His PC killed at least one example of 
every monster available in the game with the exception of Andor Drakon and 
Keethrax, which are mutually exclusive with Gaab'Baay and Yrrigs + Jharod, 
respectively. Petri used the technique outlined above, closing the chaos gate as 
soon as feasible, then finishing the game. Eleven wishes for rare monsters were 
used which required a marathon session in the blue dragon caves after the gate was 
closed. A total of 3802 ancient blue dragons were killed.

Markku Rikola posted a UCG Plutonium Man entry March 20th, 2002. The monsters which 
escaped this PC were: Gaab'Baay (of course), Keethrax (the PC chose to slay Yrrigs 
and Jharod), ancient karmic dragon, emperor lich, fairy dragon, frost giant jarl, 
great black wyrm, great white wyrm, greater mimic and small dwarf.


Steel Man

Again, very simple. Enter the wilderness and do not leave it until the PC is 
experience level 50 (optionally never eat the food the PC starts with). Entering 
any game locations is not allowed. The first example of this challenge game was 
posted January 20th, 2004 by Alex Pinachos. Extreme tactics were required.


Titanium Man

The objective here is to finish the game with the lowest experience level character 
possible. The Chaos Gate must be closed. Trolls have an obvious advantage, and 
should be considered separately for this challenge game. Alex Pinachos comlpeted 
the first example of this game on February 3rd, 2004, with an "ordinary" chaos god 
ending. The only monster the PC killed was Andor Drakon, who is worth only one 
experience point. The PC ended the game at experience level one, with 87 total 
experience points.


Other challenge-man games

(credit Malte Helmert)


Pacifist Man

Win the game while killing as few monsters as possible. The total number of kills 
in the kill list counts (the lower, the better).


Ecological Balance Man

Win the game while avoiding to kill many monsters of the same type. The maximum of 
all numbers in the kill list counts (the lower, the better).


Mediocre Man

Win the game with low attribute values. The highest attribute value (as displayed 
on the screen, i.e. including items, boosts and corruptions) ever encountered 
during the game counts (the lower, the better). Exception: If a stat is raised by a 
corruption and that corruption is removed on the turn after the character obtains 
it, the higher value does not count.


Restricted Games


Players have completed the game with a variety of different restrictions, for a 
challenge, to demonstrate that it is possible, or to point out a game feature that 
they regard as abusable or flawed.

Restricted games can involve almost anything: methods of attack, equipment used and 
religious attitude among others. The game can be completed without using the 
ratling traders as a food source. It can be completed without using the food the PC 
starts with and never buying from Munxip. It can be completed without eating any 
corpses. Never buy from shops. Kill every shopkeeper. The list is infinite...


Restricted attack games


The game has been completed using offensive attacks limited to: only magic, only 
thrown rocks, only unarmed fighting and only kicking. A game has also been 
completed where all missile and melee weapon skills were equally developed.


Restricted equipment games


Brass Man

Markku Rikola has completed the game with a PC who picked up no artifacts other 
than the chaos orbs and never used them. The PC was crowned; sixteen artifacts were 
generated during the entire game.

Steven desJardins improved upon this: He completed a game (June 2002) in which only 
the seven required artifacts (the si, Moon Sickle and the Chaos Orbs) and Whirlwind 
(randomly generated in the Casino) were generated. The artifacts were never used.


Proton Man

Petri Sihvola has completed the game (December 2001) without ever equipping any 
items. This means no armor can be worn, no missile or melee weapons can be wielded, 
no tools can be equipped and no chaos orbs can be used in the tool slot.


Carbon Fiber Man

Malte Helmert has completed the game with the most severe equipment restriction 
posssible - only 100s of inventory can be carried at any given time. This is the 
ultimate restriction possible since the Chaos Orbs themselves weigh 100s. This 
means the PC must be naked with no equipment or food when carrying a Chaos Orb. It 
also means the Chaos Orbs located above the Casino, the Fire and Water Orbs, must 
be brought past the Eternal Guardian one at a time without the Ring of the High 
Kings. Since climbing sets weigh 180s, the Tomb of the High Kings, the Rift and the 
Library are all inaccessible in this challenge game.

Upon first consideration, this game might seem impossible due to food 
considerations, but Malte reports that this was not a huge problem, although there 
were a few tense moments. The PC, a trollish monk, was careful to maintain high 
piety at all times in case of a food emergency. In addition, strategic caches of 
food, SoCRs, holy water and an amulet of death ray resistance among others were 
stored throughout the game, initially in Dwarftown then lower and lower for the 
dive into the CoC.

Malte reports the most significant problems in this challenge game were surviving 
the early game then getting the two early orbs and the PC's equipment past a 
hostile Eternal Guardian in stages.


Restricted tactics games

Many can be envisioned. The Atheist challenge is one where the PC does not 
acknowledge the existence of the gods, never asks for divine assistance and never 
uses an altar for any reason. A successful completion of this challenge game has 
been reported only once, by Griffin Knodle on April 14th, 2001. A more restrictive 
variant involves denying the existence of holy water. Holy (or unholy) water cannot

Barbarians are an obvious choice for the Berserker challenge: never change Tactics 
from berserk, and optionally never wear body armor. This challenge game has been 
completed at least once with a dwarven barbarian.

Note that the PC has to be very careful during this challenge game. No messages 
along the lines of "Do you really want to attack the -foo-" will be generated. True 
berserkers simply do not receive this message. Be very careful about moving into a 
shopkeeper, for instance.
