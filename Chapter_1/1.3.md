# 1.3 Places to avoid in the early game

There are a few locations on the wilderness map that are to be avoided for low level PCs. 
One of the more mundane is the road found in the central part of the wilderness. 
Unfortunately, the easy traveling afforded by this road attracts monsters who will try to 
kill new adventurers. It is quite likely that a hostile group of chaos brothers and 
sisters will be found on this road, as well as wandering bands of bandits and other outlaw 
types, including assassins, who use poison. Bottom line: avoid the road with a low level 
PC. Travel through the plains and forest areas instead.

As far as truly deadly areas go, the entrance to Darkforge is one. It is found in the 
central part of the map near the southern border. Darkforge itself is the second level of 
this particular dungeon. The danger level of the top level is not that high, but the down 
staircase is guarded by a steel golem. These are very tough monsters for a low level PC to 
defeat. A low level wizard who has trained the Lightning Bolt spell may have a chance but 
is asking for trouble. Another wilderness location that will kill low level PCs very 
quickly is the Tower of Eternal flames. Without good fire resistance and other special 
equipment, both the PC and his inventory will be incinerated. See section 2.19 for more on 
the Tower of Eternal Flames. Shyssiryxius' cave is difficult for low level PCs due to the 
need for water breathing or high hitpoints and on-demand teleportation, as well as the 
presence of nasty aquatic beasts such as dragon turtles. Some locations, such as the Rift 
and the Minotaur Maze, do not allow low level PCs to enter.
