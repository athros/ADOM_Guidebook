<h3>Terinyo</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-1-2-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</a><p>

Terinyo is a small hamlet, commonly the first place new players will visit in their
adventure. It is strongly advised that you do not attack any of the residents of Terinyo,
as this WILL lead to your death unless you know exactly what you are doing.<p>

<a name="121"></a><h4>1.2.1 Tywat Pare, the sheriff <tt>t</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 3, Hits: 88, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+8, Speed: 100.</pre>
Tywat Pare is source of two quests. The first
is to find and kill Kranach, a raider lord terrorizing the countryside. The rewards
for this quest are a lawful boost to alignment and 3000 gold pieces. Note that the
lawful boost is greater if a magnanimous PC leaves the 3000 gold pieces on the ground
where Tywat Pare drops them.<p>

The second quest is available once the PC reaches experience level ten. The quest
objective is to kill the crime lord Hotzenplotz, who can be found in the outlaw
village Lawenilothehl near Terinyo. Note that attacking Hotzenplotz while he is
nonhostile is a chaotic act. However, the lawful boost received when Tywat Pare is
informed of the success of the mission more than offsets this. As a reward for this
quest Tywat Pare will give the PC a blessed amulet of order, an extraordinarily useful
item. If the PC has done <i>both</i> the Kranach quest and the Hotzenplotz quest, Tywat
Pare will also teach the PC the Law skill after completing the Hotzenplotz quest.<p>

An amulet of order is also available from Tywat Pare if a lawful PC lures him to a
location where outlaw types can be found. Lawenilothehl is good for this, but a
random wilderness encounter with bandits will also work. Tywat Pare says
"Let's slay some evil bandits!" and the game generates the message "He hands you a
deputy's badge." The badge is in fact an amulet of order, which ordinarily seems to
be uncursed. Cursed or blessed amulets are possible. Note that this does not work
with raiders/raider lord despite existing bounties. Also, if he spots a criminal
in the same area as the PC but out of his/her sight, the player will be interrupted
by a message about somebody shouting "*Yippieyayyay!*".<p>

Tywat Pare will also pay a bounty for the corpse of the following
outlaw types. There is also an alignment boost of bounty / 2.
<ul>
<li>cutpurse: 5
<li>mugger: 50
<li>outlaw: 75
<li>bandit: 75
<li>raider: 100
<li>outlaw leader: 100
<li>assassin: 100
<li>raider lord: 300
<li>master assassin: 500
<li>black druid: 1000 (giving this corpse to druid is preferable)
</ul><p>

Tywat can be lured out of Terinyo by leaving town with him standing on an adjacent square.
He will then follow the PC to whichever location is visited next. For low level, weak PCs,
such as Mindcrafters, this can be extremely helpful in a wilderness ambush. Though he is
not tame, he is friendly, and if the PC lures the crowd of monsters near Tywat, he will
reliably kill one or two on each pass. He can also be brought to the Small Cave,
and monsters can be lured to him. Since the XP is not the PC's, the danger level will not increase.
He can also be used as a "first-kill-filter" for players who would attempt an ultra ending,
but would prefer also to get the Courage skill.<p>

<a name="1211"></a><h4>1.2.1.1 Kranach, the raider lord <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 3, Hits: 38, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d8+3, Speed: 105.</pre>
Kranach and his gang can be found in the wilderness around Terinyo. Finding him is
a matter of chance and thus can require considerable game time (and therefore food).
The message "You encounter a group of roving raiders" specifically designates this encounter.
There is an experience point limit for this quest. In general, Kranach flees the
Drakalor Chain if the PC reaches experience level six. The exception is Trolls, who
require more experience to advance in level. The exact limit is 5 000 xp. Note the
experience level six disqualification
especially in the case of Mindcrafters, who are very weak in melee in the early game.
They do not gain a true offensive Mindcraft ability until they reach experience level
six. Therefore it is very desirable to engage Kranach and his gang with a Mindcrafter
that is just about to achieve experience level six. Ideally, the first or second kill
after finding Kranach should raise the Mindcrafter PC to experience level six.
Note that if your companion kills Kranach, you will fail the quest. Kranach is able
to shoot arrows from great distances and his missile attacks can deal considerable amounts of damage.<p>

If Kranach leaves a corpse be sure to collect it and attempt to get it back to Tywat
Pare in Terinyo. When given the corpse, he pays a bounty of 300 gold pieces and
remarks "We'll put up his head in some public location." Later, on entering Munxip's
food store, the PC receives the message "A mummified skull hangs over the door of this
shop." Giving Kranach's corpse to the sheriff seems to be the only way for this quest
to end up in the final log's achievement list. Since said corpse only has a 10% chance
of dropping, managing that is thus a matter of luck.<p>

Note that Kranach is one of an exclusive few unique NPCs who can be wished for.<p>

<a name="122"></a><h4>1.2.2 Rynt, the village elder <tt>t</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 9, PV: 0, Hits: 14, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
Rynt provides a quest, which is mutually
exclusive with Guth'Alak's quest. The quest is to find the village carpenter Yrrigs
who has disappeared in a nearby dungeon (which does not appear unless the quest has
been assigned). The reward for this quest is lower prices in Munxip's food store
and some directions on how to proceed with the game - namely go to the Caverns of Chaos
and try save the world from the incursions of Chaos. Depending on exactly how the
quest is completed, there are additional rewards available - see section <a href="adomgb-1-6.html">1.6</a>.
The PC will receive lawful boosts during this quest, once for luring Yrrigs to Jharod
and once for reporting back to Rynt.<p>

Rynt is also a source of alignment boost when <tt>g</tt>iven healing items or stethoscope:
<ul>
<li>potion of healing: 50
<li>potion of cure poison: 100
<li>potion of extra healing: 150
<li>potion of ultra healing: 250
<li>stethoscope: 250
</ul><p>

<a name="123"></a><h4>1.2.3 Guth'Alak, the druid <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 20, PV: 12, Hits: 72, Attacks: 2, Damage: 4d6, Speed: 100.</pre>
Guth'Alak lives in the central area of Terinyo. He provides two quests. The first is to find
and kill an evil chaotic druid, Keethrax, who is found in a dungeon southeast of
Terinyo - see section <a href="adomgb-1-7.html">1.7</a>.
Note that this quest and Rynt's are mutually exclusive. There are two sets
of rewards for this quest, chosen by the PC. The PC may choose between <tt>k</tt>nowledge
and <tt>p</tt>ower. Choosing power results in gifts of a wand of cold and a spellbook of
Frost Bolt. Choosing knowledge results in Guth'Alak teaching the PC the Herbalism
skill, or Gardening, if the PC already has Herbalism at 100. Guth'Alak provides different
rewards to Druids who complete this quest: amulet of balance, ring of minor elemental
mastery, and bracers of toughness [+0,+0] {To+4}. The exact status of these three items varies.
If the PC completes the first Keethrax quest but only gets back to Guth'Alak after reaching
level 30, the rewards will be lost forever. Ordinarily, this should never happen.<p>

Guth'Alak's second quest is available only after the PC reaches experience level 30.
The quest is to find and help the Greater White Unicorn, Yrruir. This is the only
way to access the unicorn quests, whether the PC chooses to attempt Yrruir's quest
or Riurry's quest. See section <a href="adomgb-2-19.html">2.19</a>.<p>

Note that Guth'Alak's quests are Neutral. They draw alignment towards N=. If the PC's alignment
is on the lawful side of N=, these quests are technically a chaotic act.<p>

Guth'Alak will provide potion of corruption for the corpse of the following monsters:
<ul>
<li>Snake from Beyond
<li>Master Summoner
<li>Ancient Stone Beast
<li>Ancient Chaos Wyrm
<li>Greater Black Unicorn
<li>Chaos Archmage
<li>Black Druid
<li>Emperor Moloch
<li>Multi-Headed Chaos Dragon
<li>black unicorn
</ul><p>

Note that black unicorns are only non-unique monsters in this list. Since black unicorns are available
as a wilderness encounter he technically is an unlimited source of corruption removal.
Note that only neutral or lawful PCs are able to receive rewards for corpses. Guth'Alak will
take the chaos corpses from chaotic PCs but will not give a reward.<p>

Guth'Alak can turn hostile if the PC tries to chop trees in Terinyo. Even in his hostile state,
he never leaves the water area in Terinyo to pursue the PC. He is capable of defending himself and
the residents of Terinyo with glowing balls, can cast confusion, and can walk on water.
As his evil black counterpart, he is immune to non-acid elemental attacks.
He will help the PC fight Munxip if the PC angers Munxip with the right tactics.
Guth'Alak is the target of Kherab's first quest.<p>

<a name="124"></a><h4>1.2.4 Tiny Girl <tt>t</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 7, PV: 0, Hits: 1, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d1, Speed: 100.</pre>
The Tiny Girl is one of the many children of Terinyo. She is source of a quest.
The objective is to rescue her puppy from a dungeon northeast of Terinyo. The reward for
the quest is a lawful boost and a piece of candy from the Tiny Girl. Note that
this quest is difficult and entirely optional.<p>

The general approach should be to get
to the bottom of the dungeon, carefully find the puppy and get out as fast as possible
with a minimum of fighting. Note also that if the puppy is generated dead, retrieving
the corpse and returning it to the Tiny Girl still provides some lawful boost.
Furthermore this means that the quest can be done <i>at any time</i> after the PC has
gained experience thus having a better chance of surviving the dungeon.
Another way to do this quest is to just wish for a cute dog. See section
<a href="adomgb-1-8.html">1.8</a> for more details.<p>

If during the quest the PC kills the Cute Dog, and decides to tell the Tiny Girl
"The truth behind (their) evil deed", she will turn hostile. When this happens,
she can be killed without angering the rest of the townsfolk of Terinyo.<p>

<a name="125"></a><h4>1.2.5 Blup, the baby water dragon <tt>D</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 2, Hits: 26, Attacks: 3, Damage: 6d2+3, Speed: 100.</pre>
Blup is the only non-human resident of Terinyo; so is not hard to spot there.
He asks the PC to find his mother - the great water dragon Shyssiryxius.
This is not something low level PCs should attempt. It requires the ability to
breathe water, or <i>very</i> careful planning. There are also very dangerous
monsters found in the underwater cave.
Once the PC finds her, chats to her and returns to Blup with the news, she will receive an
alignment boost and (eventually) an artifact, the Rune Covered Trident.
More details can be found in section <a href="adomgb-2-13.html">2.13</a>.<p>

Blup will also teach the Swimming skill if given one blessed or two uncursed potions
of carrot juice.<p>

Bringing civil disorder to Terinyo will usually make him hostile; though if the PC is
caught shoplifting without angering the rest of the populace, he will actually fight
alongside Guth'Alak against the summoned thugs. Whilst not nearly as strong as his mother,
Blup's water breath attack is still something to be cautious of all the same.<p>

Blup enjoys candy more than children do (+10 alignment for giving candy to Blup,
+2 for children).<p>

<a name="126"><h4>1.2.6 Munxip, the shopkeeper <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 10, DV: 16, PV: 10, Hits 290, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d6+18. Speed: 140.</pre>
Munxip owns a specialty shop "Munxip's Magnificent Munchies Mall", selling food only.
5/6 of items in Munxip's shops are large rations.
Like all shopkeepers, he is <i>tough</i>. It is best for low level PCs to buy from his
shop without attempting anything dishonest. It is possible for PCs with low Strength
to simply pick up, without paying for, enough large rations to train Strength if the
PC runs around in his shop long enough. Munxip will block the door so the PC will not
be interrupted. Just do not attempt to leave without paying. ;-)<p>

Upon successful completion of Rynt's quest to save Yrrigs, Munxip will lower all his prices
as thanks for saving his friend.<p>

<a name="127"></a><h4>1.2.7 Yggaz, the fool <tt>t</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 18, Attacks: 2, Damage: 3d3+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
Yggaz is a source of rumors (see section <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f82">0.15.8.2</a>) and
will trade random potions for potions of booze. This can be quite useful, as beggars in the
nearby outlaw town of Lawenilothehl will give you a potion of booze in return for ~40 gp.<p>

<a name="128"></a><h4>1.2.8 Townspeople <tt>t</tt></h4>
<pre>Farmer: Level: 1, DV: 11, PV: 0, Hits: 6, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.
Goodwife: Level: 1, DV: 9, PV: 0, Hits: 4, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4, Speed: 100.
Child: Level: 1, DV: 7, PV: 0, Hits: 1, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d1, Speed: 100.</pre>

Farmers are found in Terinyo. A farmer corpse is a quest object for Gaab'Baay
(see section <a href="adomgb-2-1.html#216">2.1.6</a>). Farmers will also provide rations and
+10 alignment for tools, such as a scythe, and will accept seeds for a small lawful boost.
The remaining townspeople - goodwives and children - are simply flavor elements without any real importance
in the game. They can be used as cannon fodder, of course. Lure them out of town to kill them for
experience. Train Ventriloquism on them and they can then be slaughtered right in town without consequence.
Confusion Blast works similarly. If a C alignment is desired (for robbing Munxip without cursing,
for example), anything goes.<p>

<a name="129"></a><h4>1.2.9 Magical island <tt>.</tt></h4>
The magical island is a single tile surrounded by water in the center of Terinyo.
Staying on the island guarantees PP regeneration every turn.<p>
