<h3>Barbarian's Glade</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-6-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>
A geographical exploit makes the Old Barbarian's Glade the ideal place to wish for
an Emperor Moloch (which instead results in 25 or so Greater Molochs) for those PCs that
are desperate for experience. The greater molochs should be summoned on the far right side
of the map, so they will appear bunched together there. A quick teleport, and strategic use
of frost bolt will yield a perfectly safe ice island from which the
PC can snipe his way to experience level 50 with ease.<p>

Note that the Old Barbarian's Glade is a decent place to store items. He is the
only monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly generated is going
to run away with the PC's stuff. If the PC leaves items far away from the Old
Barbarian (or if he is dead), he will not have time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

<a name="261"></a><h4>2.6.1 Old Barbarian <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 12, PV: 12, Hits: 500, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d10+10, Speed: 130.</pre>
The Old Barbarian assigns a quest to kill a score (20) of the monsters the PC first killed.
As a reward for successfully completing the quest he teaches the Courage skill. The
quest is only available to non-chaotics and is not available until the PC has
killed 500 monsters. He monitors the progress towards completing it - his feedback can be
used by the player to help them remember the PC's first kill - when chatted to during his
quest he will either remark that the PC is showing promise if they have killed at least
one more of their first kill, or remark that the PC is lazy if they haven't.
Note that if the PC somehow acquires the Courage skill
after the quest is assigned but before it is completed (Bard's class power, potion
of education), returns to the Old Barbarian and <tt>C</tt>hats with him, he is surprised
and gives the PC an ordinary two-handed sword.<p>

For more about strategy for the first kill, see section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#091">0.9.1</a>.<p>

If the player does not care about the Courage skill, the Old Barbarian can be a source of
early game experience since he can be attacked from behind water squares. There is a demo
of this. This led to more problems than it solved for the demo player, because experience
level 14 was reached very quickly without the time to find equipment that was appropriate
for the level.<p>
