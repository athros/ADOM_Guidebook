<h3>Unicorn Glades</h3>
Guth'Alak, the druid in Terinyo, will reveal the location of the Greater
White Unicorn's glade once the PC reaches experience level 30, regardless
of the PC's alignment. He asks the PC to search a beautiful park in the
central forest for a good and noble creature in need of help. Upon
returning to the central forest, the glade appears as a green asterisk near
the Old Barbarian's clearing. It is described as "A beautiful park."

After entering the glade, Yrruir can be found teleporting around randomly.
Despite the fact that Guth'Alak reveals this location regardless of alignment,
Yrruir generally attacks PCs with chaotic alignment on sight. There have
been rare and scattered reports of chaotic PCs who were not attacked.
Yrruir will not attack a lawful PC even if she is attacked by them.
When <tt>C</tt>hatted with, Yrruir explains that the forces of Chaos have stolen a part
of her life essence and forged it into her evil counterpart, manifested as a
Greater Black Unicorn. Yrruir asks the PC to kill her counterpart in order
to regain the stolen life essence and restore her full powers. If the PC is
successful, Yrruir rewards the PC with an offer to cleanse all corruption
<i>once</i> and only once. A player who completes this quest has to carefully
decide when to take advantage of Yrruir's offer. If the PC is badly corrupted
prior to entering the lowest parts of the CoC, it will probably be necessary
to have all corruption removed before the endgame. However, it is best to
have Yrruir remove all corruption as the last thing the PC does before leaving
the Drakalor Chain, if the player is concerned with receiving the highest
possible score and happiest future history after finishing.<p>

<a name="2j2"></a><h4>2.19.2 Riurry, the greater black unicorn <tt>U</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 60, PV: 18, Hits: 666, Attacks: 1, Damage: 8d6+12, Speed: 100.</pre>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-19-2-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>

Riurry can be found in a corrupted glade just east of Yrruir's glade. As an
evil chaotic being, he of course offers rewards if the PC kills Yrruir when
<tt>C</tt>hatted with. If the PC then returns to Yrruir, she is warned not to listen
to Riurry's evil babbling. Killing Yrruir at this point will result in a
significant alignment drop, of course, but causes no other noticeable effects.
The PC does not lose the Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics, nor does she gain the
Cursed or Doomed intrinsics. Returning to Riurry and <tt>C</tt>hatting results in
being rewarded with 1-2 corruptions, a blessed amulet of chaos and 3d3 uncursed
potions of gain attributes. The player has to decide which path to take. The
potions of gain attributes are a significant reward. If the player is going for
an Ultimate Chaos God ending, it seems logical to accept Riurry's quest. Other
PCs may choose this quest if corruption is either not a problem or desired for
chaos gate entry. The alignment drop may also be useful for becoming chaotic
around experience level 30 in order to receive Gaab'Baay's quests, for those PCs
attempting an ultra ending.<p>
