There are of course Ancardian day and date effects as well, which are well covered in the <a href="adomman-B.html#B1">ADOM Manual</a>.
One Ancardian time effect not mentioned is the fact that the PC's range of sight depends on the time of day on the overworld map and in the wilderness.
During the day (which apparently begins around 6h), the PC sees further, and at night (which apparently begins around 20h) the
PC's sight is limited to 2 squares on the overworld map, 5 in the wilderness. Terrain, Perception score, whether or not using lit torch(es),
necklace of the eye, and the Farsight spell all contribute to the sight range.<p>

Press <tt>@</tt> or <tt>Ctrl-e</tt> to learn Ancardian month, day, and time. You start the game at day 1 of Unicorn, at midnight.<p>

Check out the <a href="adomman-B.html#B2">ADOM Manual</a> for general game-related effect of starsigns.
Additional tips are provided here.

<ol type="A">
<li>Raven<p>
The +10 to Speed is good for all PCs. It can save the life of low level
PCs who need to run away from a monster they can't handle. The "messengers
will reach you faster" refers to the delivery of the rune-covered trident,
which happens faster for those born in this month, at level 16 rather than 36, a nice bonus. The "harder
to trick by deceptions" grants resistance to confusion attacks by dopplegangers.
The stronger companions characteristic makes this month excellent for <b>Bards</b>.
The Raven birthsign gives you a 75% chance to evade a doppleganger's confusion attack.<p>

<li>Book<p>
Lawful tendencies is a weak effect. One free skill increase each level helps
all PCs, especially those with low learning. Increased chance to learn spells
means borderline casters have a better chance. This is not the ideal month for
a Wizard - they are already great at learning spells. More suited to
<b>elven fighting classes</b> or a <b>Dwarvish Paladin</b>. The Book birthsign
decreases alignment changes towards chaotic by 10%. Book-born characters get
an undocumented +3 boost to Learning.<p>

<li>Wand<p>
Here we have the sign for a <b>neutral Wizard</b>. Gray Elven Wizards are ideal
with their naturally high Mana and neutral alignment. They are somewhat
difficult to keep alive in the early game but become enormously powerful in
the mid- and endgame. The Wand birthsign decreases alignment changes towards chaotic
by 10%.<p>

<li>Unicorn<p>
Generic sign with resistance to corruption. Pretty attractive for any PC
going for an ultra ending, especially an aspiring <b>Avatar of Order</b>. The fact
that lawful alignment is difficult to change means such a PC can commit a
few chaotic acts and get away with it without becoming a fallen champion.
Also nice for an aspiring (ultimate) <b>Chaos God</b>, since crowned chaotics are
corrupted more rapidly than others. The Unicorn birthsign reduces corruption by 19% if
you are L, by 37% if L+, and increases it by 30% for C-. Due to a bug, it also
increases alignment changes towards chaotic by 20%.<p>

<li>Salamander<p>
Very attractive for <b>Elementalists</b>, who rely on a lot of fire magic. Not
half bad for a <b>Necromancer</b> who finds some fire-based spellbooks, either.
Necromancers need that +3 to Mana.<p>

<li>Dragon<p>
<b>Fighters</b>. The +1 to Toughness is not significant - that is within the
variability for the attribute for identical race/class PCs. The -3 to Willpower
is significant and makes this unattractive for those who need it in the early
game - Wizards, Mindcrafters. Not a bad month for <b>Paladins</b> with both weapon
and combat magic costs reduced.<p>

<li>Sword<p>
Learning bonus is insignificant, although it can push a PC from illiterate to
literate. The 20% reduction in cost to train melee weapon skills makes this
attractive for a PC that really wants to become super-proficient with a weapon.
Not a bad choice for <b>Rangers</b> who start the game dual wielding swords.<p>

<li>Falcon<p>
Grants the Survival skill to any character. This skill is generally considered as
being of little use (see section <a href="adomgb-0-4.html">0.4</a>).
The Willpower bonus is somewhat useful for
spellcasters and <b>Mindcrafters</b>, although better starsigns exist for those classes.
The Charisma bonus is of little significance for any character, with the possible
exception of <b>Bards, Necromancers and male Merchants</b>. The free talent is good for
all PCs, especially for gnomish and hurthling Bards, as it guarantees them both
a very useful Heir gift and the possibility to go for the Treasure Hunter talent.<p>

<li>Cup<p>
Another sign for <b>Wizards</b>. Higher Learning to start and the 10% reduction to
gain a level means they advance rapidly, which is very helpful in keeping them
alive at low level. The 20% effectivity increase in learning spells also helps
keep them alive in the early game, while the player has not had time to raise
their Learning score.<p>

<li>Candle<p>
This can be an unbelievable sign for <b>Trolls</b>. They heal rapidly anyway, but those
born in this month almost don't need the Healing skill! Almost. Get it and they
seem to have natural regeneration. Playing a <b>trollish Healer</b> born in this month
is almost cheating. ;-) Candle-born characters are guaranteed to heal 2 hitpoints
every 12 turns.<p>

<li>Wolf<p>
Significant benefits to Perception and Willpower. The Willpower is good for
<b>Wizards</b> and <b>Mindcrafters</b>, of course. Races that start with lower Perception
include <b>Dwarves, Orcs</b> and of course <b>Trolls</b>.<p>

<li>Tree<p>
Made for <b>Mindcrafters</b>, who really need that +5 to Willpower in the early game.
Not bad for <b>Wizards</b> either. The Tree birthsign reduces all alignment changes by 10%.<br>
<small> As of v1.2.0, Tree also gets +2 To and +1 PV.</small><p>
</ol><p>

The Candle starsign is by far the best for any character, with Raven being the distant second.
The Candle healing effect is great for everyone and it is better than the Healing skill at 100.
Raven's speed bonus allows all characters to outrun most opponents.
The effects of other starsigns are utterly negligible when compared to Raven and especially Candle.<p>

<a name="0122"></a><h4>0.1.2.2 Special birth messages</h4>
If you are really lucky, one of these messages could be generated along with the star sign.
<ul>
<li>The night you were born....<br>
...the local undead were seen packing up and moving away.<br>
It means that your character will gain (or is born with?) the "natural
enemy of undead" intrinsic. This makes undead flee from you periodically.
This also means you always slay undead in melee - same effect as !Unde weapons.<p>

<li>...your long lost brother showed up.<br>
Greater chance of special locations generated in dungeons (hives, shops,
pools, etc).<p>

<li>...a two headed calf was born.<br>
10% less experience points are required for an experience level increase.<p>

<li>...a falling star killed the village elder.<br>
10% less experience points are required for an experience level increase.<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="013"></a><h4>0.1.3 Sex</h4>
The sex of the character has little significance. The following table lists
all known gameplay differences.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Gender differences</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th>Male <th>Female <th>More info
<tr><td>Start with <td>+1 St <td>+1 Dx <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>Shop prices depend on <td>Ch <td>Ap <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>Wedding ring works for Banshee <td>yes <td>no <td><a href="adomgb-3-10.html">3.10</a>
<tr><td>Wedding ring tames <td>berserkers <td>female berserkers <td><a href="adomgb-0-11.html#0b3">0.11.3</a>
<tr><td>Frog quest is available <td>no <td>yes <td><a href="adomgb-app-K.html">Appendix K</a>
<tr><td>Cheaper keys <td>no <td>yes <td><a href="adomgb-1-3.html#134">1.3.4</a>
<tr><td>Base Smithing cost <td>5000 gp <td>5250 gp <td><a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f4">0.15.4</a>
</table><p>

<!-- Besides from slight starting attribute modifications (+1 St vs. +1 Dx),
it is a wedding ring, which protects only male PC's from Banshee wail (more on this in
<a href="adomgb-2-17.html">2.17</a>), and the frog quest, which is available only to female characters
(see <a href="adomgb-app-K.html">Appendix K</a> for details). Also, Appearance is used when interacting
with NPC's of opposite gender, while Charisma is used when interacting with NPC's of the same gender, and
when interacting with animals. Since most important NPC's are male - particularly shopkeepers, who offer
prices according to female's Appearance/male's Charisma, it could be concluded that Appearance has
little more significance for females and Charisma for males.<p> -->

<a name="014"></a><h4>0.1.4 Race and class</h4>
A list of the races and classes can be found in the <a href="adomman-C.html">ADOM Manual</a>. It also gives a bit of background about each,
much of which is flavor and irrelevant in terms of gameplay.<p>

<a name="0141"></a><h4>0.1.4.1 Specific starting trained skills and alignment</h4>
Each race has unique characteristics including initial alignment, trained skills and modifiers to attributes.
Skills in ADOM vary in terms of availability. All PCs are born with Climbing [1dDx + 1d10 + 20], First Aid [1dLe + 1d10 + 15],
Haggling [1dCh + 1d10 + 15], and Listening [1dPe + 1d10 + 20].
All PCs other than Beastfighters and Barbarians with a Learning score of 10 or greater are born with Literacy [Le*4].
Many skills can be taught or trained by various NPCs during the game. Other skills are much more difficult
to obtain if the PC is not born with them. Skills other than Alertness and Healing can be wished for.
Any skill can be obtained from a potion of education, but this is a matter of random chance and cannot be counted
on. Skills available only from wishes or potions of education are referred to as "Nonguaranteed Skills" for the
sake of the tables below. The first table shows the starting alignment and trained skills [starting value] that each race is born
with. For all starting values, please consider 1dx as 1dx-1, ie generating a random number between 0 and x-1.
So 1d5+5 means a value between 5 and 9. Consider ydx (y &gt; 1) normally.<p>

<a name="01411"></a><table border=1><caption>Race-specific starting alignment and trained skills</caption>

</table><p>

Lawful alignment is +2000, neutral is 0, and chaotic -2000. This is then modified by class: Druids have alignment
set to 0, Necromancers get -1500 and Healers get +1000.<p>

[1] Bards never get: Necromancy, Bridge Building, Tactics, Law, Courage. Every other skill (except Music) has 25% chance, with starting value of [1d20 + 15].<p>
[2] If specializing in potions, then Alchemy [1dLe], else if specializing in scrolls then Literacy [1d20 + 30] else (wands or rings) Survival [1d20 + 20].<p>

Falcon birthsign increases Survival by 10, or grants Survival at 10 if there was no Survival by race or class.<p>

<a name="01413"></a>
The manual also states that Bards get more skills than other classes. Testing does not agree with this.
What the manual fails to mention is the two free skill advances per level Bards receive. This is useful
for races that have low initial Learning scores, such as Orcs and Trolls.<p>

There are definite effects on gameplay depending on the alignment, skills and birthsign the PC is born with.
Note that none of the races is born with the Healing skill; it is entirely class-dependent. Nine classes are
born with Healing. It is essential to obtain this skill (except for those born under Candle). This means that
those without it <i>must</i> choose
Rynt's quest as opposed to Guth'Alak's in Terinyo, whether they intend to actually obtain the skill from Jharod
or Kranf Niest. This puts restrictions on the game right away, since the Keethrax quest and thus a guaranteed
artifact and potion of cure corruption are forfeited before the game even starts. Further, three races start with
chaotic alignment. If the PC wants to receive Healing from Jharod, thus avoiding Kranf Niest's attribute drains,
alignment must be changed to neutral (or lawful).<p>

Note also that no race starts with Herbalism, the other skill available through a Terinyo quest. If the player
wants maximum flexibility - to do either Rynt's or Guth'Alak's quest, or neither (in the case of a minimalist
challenge game) - choose a class that starts with Healing, Herbalism, or ideally both, such as a Beastfighter,
Druid, Healer, Priest, Ranger or Wizard.<p>

If there is a skill that is difficult to obtain that you cannot live without, such as Alertness, play a Dark Elf
or Drakeling, or choose a class that is born with it - Archers, Healers, Monks, Rangers and Thieves all start with
this skill. Many players feel similarly about Detect Item Status - play Priests or a Merchant for a challenge.<p>

A PC that trains a given skill due to both race and class will be especially proficient with that skill. This
makes certain combinations especially powerful. Dwarven Weaponsmiths (doubly trained Metallurgy and Smithing),
Hurthling Archers (doubly trained Archery), Hurthling Farmers (doubly trained Archery, Cooking, Food Preservation,
Gardening, Stealth) and Dark Elven Rangers (doubly trained Alertness and Climbing) are examples.<p>

[1] Can be ANY skill, and does not have the restrictions imposed on character creation. Bards gain 1d20 + 20 in those skills.<p>
[2] Stolen items must have at least 10 value.<p>
[3] Trains St by (Level*5)-155)*4, Dx by (Level*5)-155), and To by ((Level*3)-93)*10.<p>
[4] Shadow Touch will regain HP first; if maxed, it will regain PP instead. PP Gained is DamageDealt / 2, HP Gained is DamageDealt / 3.
There is DamageDealt/1000 chance to get +1 Mana. If 1d10000-1 &lt; damage dealt, you gain 1 Mana.<p>
[5] Also receives only 1/3 of drowning damage.<p>
[6] Melting ability is determined by the weight of what you're melting down as far as how many ingots you'll get. This means for example ultra-heavy armors
are especially nice for melting down. Blessed hammer + blessed metal = 9:1000 (9 ingots for 1000 stones); B+U = 8,1:1000; B+C = 6,3:1000; U+U = 7,2:1000; U+C = 5,6:1000; C+C = 4,4:1000.
Failing a Smithing roll halves the amount you get.<p>

<a name="01433"></a>Higher Xp number means more experience is required to advance a level.<p>
<!--- Note on the Xp column. It represents how hard is a particular race/class to advance levels. Basically, multiply
the two numbers to get a Xp ratio. For Cup borns (and some starting messages), multiply again with 0.9. There are
few exceptions to this rule however:
Troll Farmers and Troll Merchants have Xp ratio of 3, and Orc Priests have 1.4.
Xp ratio of 1 means the PC will require about 150 xp to advance to lvl 2. It varies depending on starting attributes,
lower attributes mean lower lvl 2 requirement, so weaker PC's have somewhat easier time when advancing levels.
Multiply 150 with Xp ratio to get approximated level 2 xp requirement. For higher levels, multiply the xp needed
for previous level by x, where x gradually decreases from 1.9 to 1.0666.<p>--->

The <a href="adomman-C.html#C2">ADOM Manual</a> gives some hints about race/class combinations. For instance, the manual identifies Trolls
as the strongest, toughest and stupidest race in the game and suggests that they make good fighters (because
of their Strength and Toughness) and lousy magicians (because of their low Learning and Mana). This is true
as far as it goes, but Trollish Wizards can be a viable combination if they are played more as fighters to
start and later develop their magical talents. Elves make fantastic Wizards (due to their high Learning and
Mana) once they gain some experience, but are difficult to keep alive in the early game because of their low
Toughness. Humans are a jack of all trades race and can be used with all classes. Some combinations favored
by newsgroup readers:
<ul>
<li><b>Trollish Beastfighters and Barbarians</b> - brute force fighters
<li><b>Gnomish Elementalists</b> - magic users with more Toughness than elves
<li><b>Elven Archers</b> - natural talent with bows
<li><b>Elven Wizards</b> - high Mana and Learning
<li><b>Dwarven Weaponsmiths</b> - natural smithing talent
<li><b>Hurthling Archers</b> - natural talent with thrown rocks
</ul><p>

Classes and combinations that are regarded as difficult:
<ul>
<li><b>Farmers</b>
<li><b>Merchants</b>, especially Dark Elven Merchants because of their low Charisma and Toughness
<li><b>Necromancers</b> in general are very difficult to keep alive at low levels
</ul><p>

Press <tt>B</tt> to determine your age and age category. You can start the game as either young or grownup.
The age category has definite effects on your attribute scores, listed in the effects fields.
Generally, you lose Strength, Toughness, Appearance, and Perception with age. On the other hand, you gain Learning, Willpower, and Mana.
During normal game, you naturally age very slowly, and this should almost never become any problem. However, undead attacks may unnaturally change your
age and age category very quickly, depending on race. Use potions of youth to reverse the effects of unnatural aging.
Potions of longevity increase your max age. Beware of cursed potions of youth and longevity though - they may result in an immediate death of
old age.<p>

<a name="0145"></a><h4>0.1.4.5 Special considerations</h4>
<b>Dark Elves</b> - Dark Elves receive very low offers and high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop. Dark Elven
Necromancers are very Chaotic. It takes some work to get them to Neutral alignment to receive Healing from Jharod,
for instance, if that is desired. Dark Elves are unique in that spider corpses are nutritious for them. Poison
resistance can still be gained from spider corpses. Also, if a Dark Elven PC is caught in a web and covered by 
"hundreds of tiny spiders", he/she won't be bitten and thus won't get poisoned (instead, the message "You welcome 
your spidery friends." is generated after the spiders swarm). Unlike most other races, Dark Elves' line of sight increases
in the nighttime and decreases during the daytime.<p>

<b>Drakelings</b> - Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF (see section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html">2.5</a>)
and D: 49 (see section <a href="adomgb-3-23.html">3.23</a>).
Drakelings who are unlucky enough to find a greater white dragon vault will also face speed problems. Drakelings
have a unique racial acid spit - press <tt>m</tt> to use it - which does Max(2,Level/3)d6+(Level/2) damage, has Max(2, St/4) range, hits
target if 1d(Level+10)+Dx &gt; MonstersDV+3, and consumes 5d10+50 food points per spit.<p>

<b>Dwarves</b> - Dwarves have unique access to the Mithril skin talent (+3 PV), and they find secret doors quicker. Also,
they are more likely to receive the Rolf's Saviour artifact, and they can read runes on Griff Bloodax's grave.<p>

<b>Humans</b> - No known inherent racial abilities.<p>

<b>Hurthlings</b> - Hurthlings start the game with the Thrown Rocks missile weapon skill at level four. They also
start the game wearing a cursed ring, unfortunately. Hurthlings also have a racial dislike for shoes, which causes
a loss of Dexterity when Hurthlings use footwear in ADOM. Hurthlings also have an advantage over other races when
training the slings and thrown rocks missile weapon skills: they require only two thirds of the marks other races
do in order to advance a skill level.<p>

<b>Elves</b> - All elves, High, Gray, or Dark, have very long lifespans. This is worth considering since several
of the high level monsters encountered in ADOM have an aging attack. Ghost Lords, for instance, may well age a
Human or Troll to death in one or two hits, since these PCs have a life span of 100 years or so at most.
Elven PCs do not need to worry about this, since they live for about 1000 years. Balancing this is
the fact that they are more fragile than other races in terms of Toughness in the early game.<p>

<b>Gnomes</b> - Gnomes require only 3/4 the number of missile weapon marks to advance their crossbow skill level
relative to other races.<p>

<b>Orcs</b> - Like Dark Elves, Orcs receive very low offers and high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop.
Orcs have a short lifespan relative to other races. Unlike most other races, Orcs' line of sight increases 
in the nighttime and decreases during the daytime.<p>

<b>Trolls</b> - Trools need about double the amount of food compared to other races. They advance in experience level 
very slowly relative to other races. Trolls start the game with the Twohanded Weapons melee skill at level two. Do not 
pay any attention to this if you are playing a trollish Beastfighter. Drop that club and fight unarmed.<p>

<b>Archers</b> - Archers find more ammunition and start at skill level 1 for their starting missile weapon.<p>  

<b>Assassins</b> - First Alchemy recipe is always for potion of poison. Assassins can receive the Filk quest as soon as level 30.<p>

<b>Barbarians</b> and <b>Beastfighters</b> - With the exception of Elves, they start illiterate. They also face huge difficulties learning spells.<p>

<b>Bards</b> - Bards have an advantage when using Music; their chances for taming/calming down monsters is higher
than other classes. Also, pets won't turn on a Bard upon triggering traps on them. Moreover, Bards will find more variation in 
item modifiers: to-hit/to-damage boni in weapons/missiles and DV/PV boni in armor.<p>

<b>Druids</b> - All Druids start at neutral zero alignment, and get spellbook of Lightning Bolt. Non-summoned
animals are neutral towards Druids (including cats). Bugs in the bug-infested temple are not included. Druids need 50% more marks 
to increase a weapon skills. They get a different reward for completing the Druid quest.<p>

<b>Farmers</b> - Farmers start the game with a large dog pet, level two in Polearms weapon skill and require 20% less marks
to increase their Polearms level.<p>

<b>Fighters</b> - No known inherent class abilities.<p>

<b>Healers</b> - The number of turns usually required for natural HP regeneration is halved for Healers. They do not spend any turns whilst 
using a stethoscope.<p>

<b>Merchants</b> - Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings, scrolls, or wands. This specialization
allows them to identify any item in that category on sight. Merchants have the ability to use thrown gold pieces as
effective missiles. Dopplegangers are not able to deflect gold pieces thrown by Merchants. This is the only known way
to attack dopplegangers with missiles. Merchants also receive better shop prices, the exception is Terinyo shop. They also 
find more shops.<p>

<b>Monks</b> - Monks are expert kickers. They start off with a base damage of 1d10 to kicking, which increases as they gain levels - but lose the bonuses if 
burdened or worse. They cannot injure themselves by kicking the air. Their food consumption is about half the rate of other classes. Monks do not lose Mana 
when writing scrolls. They start with no gold, except when picking the "Wealthy" talents.<p>

<b>Mindcrafters</b> - Mindcrafters possess really unique Mindcraft abilities no other class can ever obtain. The <tt>Ctrl-i</tt>
command is used to invoke Mindcraft. More on the Mindcraft abilities in section <a href="adomgb-0-5.html#053">0.5.3</a>.
Mindcrafters have extremely hard time learning spells from books.<p>

<b>Necromancers</b> - The manual states that level 50 Necromancers can return from the dead if their Toughness is greater
than 10. It goes on to say that they lose one-half of their Toughness when this happens. It does not mention that if their
equipment keeps their Toughness at 10 or more, they can do this indefinitely. Necromancers suffer from low dice modifiers on
their skills, finding difficulties to advance Concentration, limited by a 1d3 or 1d5 modifier. Of equal importance for
Necromancers is Food Preservation, similarly limited. In contrast, Rangers, Bards and Beastfighters can expect very high
4d5 modifiers on most of their skills. Necromancers also need 100% more marks to increase weapon skills. Like Wizards, Necromancers
find all spells (including Wish) in the Library. Finally, they can perform Necromancy very efficiently - see <a href="adomgb-0-11.html#0b6">0.11.6</a>.<p>

<b>Paladins</b> and <b>Priests</b> cannot use their class powers if they do not have enough piety with their deity. They also find more
spellbooks. Priests need 50% more marks to increase weapon skills. Paladins do double damage with Justifier.<p>

<b>Rangers</b> - Rangers do not receive the -6 penalty to-hit on each weapon when fighting with two weapons, like other classes do.<p>

<b>Thieves</b> - Along with Dark Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves, Thieves have easier time finding secret doors.<p>

<b>Weaponsmiths</b> - Your PC can never start out burdened - Strength will be raised enough so that the PC can handle the weight.
Weaponsmiths start with a very heavy 1000s anvil; this can give weaker races, like Hurthlings, a large, free Strength boost.
Weaponsmiths of course have easier time Smithing - see section <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f4">0.15.4</a> for details.<p>

<b>Wizards</b> - Wizards born under the Salamander birthsign always start with spellbook of Fire Bolt. Wizards
have easier time writing scrolls. They find more spellbooks than other classes, and they find all spellbokks in the Library, including Wish.
On the negative side, Wizards require twice as many weapon marks to advance weapon skill levels.<p>

<b>Beastfighters</b> and <b>Monks</b> increase their Speed, DV, to-hit and damage with level.
Beastfighters lose their bonuses if using weapons. Monks get no bonuses if Burdened or worse, wearing a shield,
or an armor other than robe, black robe, clean robe, clothes, elven chain mail, Shirt of the Saints, Robes of Resistance.
The Speed bonus for both classes is lvl/2, to-hit bonus is lvl*2 + lvl/3 - (lvl-1)/5 - 1.
Beastfighter's damage is 1d(4+lvl/3*2) + lvl/2+lvl/4, Monk's damage is 1d(8+lvl) + lvl/4. Beastfighters get +1 DV every
third level, Monks get +1 DV in two levels out of three. Monks get also bonuses to kicking if not wielding weapons (they start with 1d10).

Four paragraphs describe PC's history (or <tt>B</tt>ackground): information about parents, childhood, youthhood, and young adulthood.
All of these are pretty random and have little significance - different descriptions probably modify slightly
starting attributes. Additional research is needed on this topic.<p>

<a name="0151"></a><table border=1><caption>0.1.5.1 History messages</caption>
<tr><th>Period<th>Message
<tr><td rowspan=5>Parents
<td>Your parents belong to the lower class. They were honest

shepherd.

things.
