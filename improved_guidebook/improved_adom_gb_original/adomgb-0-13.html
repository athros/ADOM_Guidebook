<a name="0d2"></a><h4>0.13.2 Traps <tt>^</tt></h4>
Traps are exactly what the name implies. They are represented by carets <tt>^</tt> in the dungeon maps
once they are discovered.<p>

<a name="0d21"></a><h4>0.13.2.1 Trap types</h4>
There are several varieties which do various nasty things to the PC
or his worn or carried inventory:<p>

<a name="0d21"></a><table border=1><caption>Traps</caption>
<tr><th>Type<th>Caret<th>Description
<tr><td>Acid <td>green <td>Damages or destroys non-artifact worn equipment.

<tr><td>Alarm <td>orange <td>Warns every monster on the level of the PC's presence and causes them to become hostile; disarm with potion of oil.

<tr><td>Arrow <td>white <td>Shoots an arrow at the PC; can be exploited to gain arrows; there is
more than 5% chance to be hit, in which case the arrow does 1d10+2 - PV
damage, 1/3 is chance for the arrow to not break, and 1/30 chance for the trap to vanish.

<tr><td>Ceiling <td>dark blue <td>Drops a portion of the ceiling on the PC; found on levels with forbidden teleportation replacing teleportation traps.

<tr><td>Corruption <td>purple <td>Corrupts the PC; a relatively small effect (~55 CP).

<tr><td>Explosion <td>red <td>Generates a fireball at the location of the trap.

<tr><td>Light <td>yellow <td>Blinds the PC.

<tr><td>Simple Pit <td>brown <td>PC falls into a hole; can be used to train Climbing and Dx; deals 3d6 damage; if discovered and Dx>23, trap is always avoided and Dx is trained.

<tr><td>Pit with vipers <td>brown OR cyan <td>Appear as cyan caret if detected with a
wand of trap detection, brown caret if detected with the Detect Traps skill (this may well be a bug);
(Ma/500)% chance is to avoid the trap entirely WITHOUT discovering, trains Ma. Dx/40 is chance to avoid
falling in pit, vipers still come out. 2d6 vipers spawned.

<tr><td>Spear <td>brown <td>Shoots a spear at the PC; can be exploited as a source of metal.

<tr><td>Stone block <td>gray <td>Drops a stone block on the PC; can kill low level PCs; (Ma/500)% chance
to avoid entirely WITHOUT discovering, this trains Ma. Damage is 4d10 - PV, 1/2 chance to create rocks.

<tr><td>Teleportation <td>light green <td>Teleports the PC; sometimes handy for on-demand teleportation.

<tr><td>Water <td>blue <td>Causes a gush of water; can destroy scrolls if the PC does not
have a waterproof blanket to protect the backpack; rusts vulnerable armor and weapons;
unavoidable besides Alertness &amp; Sixth Sense.
</table><p>

Traps can be deliberately set off by standing on the trap and pressing <tt>Ctrl-t</tt>.<p>

It should be noted that traps affect monsters as well as the PC: light traps will blind monsters,
corruption traps will corrupt monsters, acid traps will damage monsters, etc. An interesting use
for an alarm trap is to lure a monster across it. Other monsters will become hostile towards the
monster which triggered the trap and attack it. This can be very handy for disposing of cats (see
section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#092">0.9.2</a>).<p>

Traps can be discovered with the Detect Traps skill. PCs with this skill automatically apply
it when the <tt>s</tt>earch command is used. In ordinary dungeons it is not worth using this technique,
but in heavily trapped areas (the underground level of the Dwarven Graveyard, the Pyramid, the Assassin's Guild, the
Mana temple) it is definitely prudent to use this skill multiple times during every
turn where the PC suspects a trap is present.<p>

Traps are much easier to avoid once they are discovered, probably by a factor of 100 or more.
This is why the Detect Traps skill is so useful. Every PC should attempt to gain this skill.
Wands of trap detection can be used for this, but they run out of charges. They can be recharged of
course, but the skill never runs out and is unaffected by the mana battery corruption.<p>

Note that it is not possible to use the <tt>w5</tt> (walk in place) command while standing on a trap.<p>

Finally, bear in mind that PCs with high Alertness, Mana, Dexterity attributes and the
Sixth Sense talent will avoid undiscovered traps much more successfully than those
without these abilities.<p>

<a name="0d22"></a><h4>0.13.2.2 Trap pattern</h4>
Traps occur in a known pattern. The order, left to right or top to bottom, is:
<a name="0d22"></a><ul>
<li>Light
<li>Corruption
<li>Stone block
<li>Alarm
<li>Arrow
<li>Acid
<li>Pit with vipers
<li>Spear
<li>Teleportation/Ceiling
<li>Water
<li>Fireball
<li>Simple Pit
</ul><p>

There are several places on fixed-layout levels where trap types and locations are shown in
these documents. Note that trap types, in particular, are dependent upon the dungeon level
where the fixed-layout level in question is generated. Examples include Dwarftown and (most of)
the elemental temples. There is generally a warning in those sections concerning variations
caused by differing dungeon level. There is also variability introduced if the player chooses
to play with nonstandard resolution. There is no warning about this factor. Nevertheless, the
above pattern applies; identifying a single trap allows the player to predict the type of trap
generated elsewhere on the level.<p>

<a name="0d3"></a><h4>0.13.3 Doors <tt>/</tt><tt>+</tt></h4>
There are doors on many of the dungeon room entrances. The majority of doors are not a problem, as you can easily <tt>o</tt>pen and <tt>c</tt>lose them.
However, they can be locked or locked and trapped. Doors are generated with the following probabilities:
open door: 45%, closed door: 25%, doorway (no door): 20%, locked only door: 3%, locked and trapped door: 7%.<p>

<a name="0d31"></a><h4>0.13.3.1 Locked doors</h4>
Locked doors can be opened using several methods. Safe ways are:
<ul>
<li>Unlocking with the proper blessed key - a message is generated: "You notice a clicking sound." meaning a trap was bypassed.
Keys are randomly found in the dungeons. Skriek, the ratling in Lawenilothehl, also sells keys. You can unlock door with the unlock command - <tt>Ctrl-u</tt>, or you
can just <tt>U</tt>se the correct key.
<li>Zapping blessed or uncursed wand knocking.
<li>Casting the Knock / Divine Key spell.
<li>Using the Silver Key, which is an artifact tool that can open all doors.
<li>Throwing an anvil or huge rock from some distance, unluckily this destroys the door
(as opposed to simply opening it). And, in the case of the door being trapped, it also destroys the anvil/huge rock.
<li>Bypassing via digging or teleportation.
<li>Ordering a pet that can smash doors to walk through it.
<li>Using the Mindcrafter power Telekinetic Blast, this always destroys untrapped doors but has no effect on trapped ones.
</ul><p>

Non-safe ways:
<ul>
<li>Kicking it down - some players recommend trying to open doors multiple times before kicking it, so as to set off any traps,
as you really do not want be blind stunned and surrounded by multiple opponents. An unsuccessful attempt to
kick down a non-trapped door yields the message "You kick the door but it does not budge." An
unsuccessful attempt to kick down a trapped door yields the message "You kick the door but it does
not budge at all." In this case the PC was extremely lucky, since kicking a trapped door almost
invariably sets off the trap.
<li>Using uncursed and especially cursed keys - these might set off traps and break in process.
<li>Using the Pick Locks skill - this always sets of a trap if one is present.
</ul><p>

Under some conditions player might want to lock doors to isolate part of the level or stop monsters from pursuing the character.
Locked rooms are also recommended for storing items. General ways to lock (and sometimes also trap) a door are:
<ul>
<li>Using a regular key of the correct type. Non blessed ones might break in the process.
<li>Using the Silver Key.
<li>Casting Magic Lock / Seal of the Spheres spell.
<li>Cursed wand of knocking will lock door.
<li>Applying the Pick Locks skill on unlocked door. This method has a chance to fail.
<li>Wand of door creation sometimes creates locked doors, which usually are trapped. Very unreliable.
<li>Wand of trap creation if <tt>z</tt>apped on "doorway" square will create trapped and locked door instead of conventional trap.
Additionally zapping trap creation wand on present door will close and trap it.
</ul><p>

<a name="0d32"></a><h4>0.13.3.2 Trapped doors <tt>\</tt></h4>
There are different types of door traps:<p>

<a name="0d321"></a><table border=1>
<caption>Door trap types</caption>
<tr><th>Type<th>Description
<tr><td>Trick door trap<td>Drops door directly in front of doorway, damages the PC and worn equipment;
first chance to evade: ((Pe+Luck)/30) %, second chance to evade: (Dodge/200) %; damage: Min(10,DL+3)d4 - (PV of head armor); if evaded, trains Pe and Dx.

<tr><td>Booby trap <td>Similar to the explosive rune trap, generates a fireball, can injure companions, making them become hostile. Damage is Min((DL+3)d4,100).

<tr><td>Stone block trap<td>Similar to the collapsing door, drops stones directly in front of the door,	can kill low level PCs. 
(Dx+Luck)/30 chance to jump back (if there's space to do it, of course). Otherwise, 3d10-PV damage.

<tr><td>Explosive rune<td>Arguably the worst door trap, destroys a variety of worn items and backpack items and damages the PC; can injure companions, making
them become hostile; a new effect in ADOM 1.1.x+ is possible deafening of the PC.	Damage dealt is (Min(DL+1,16)d6)*x/2, where	x is 1 if you "partially evade the explosion" 
(depends on Dx and Luck) or 2 otherwise.

<tr><td>Stunning rune<td>If you have stun resistance, you only get "You receive a minor electric shock."
Otherwise: If you can see the tile you're standing on, you have a (Dx+Luck)/30 chance to avoid being
stunned for (DLd4) turns. If you fail the roll, in addition to being stunned another roll (Pe+Luck)/30
determines if you get blinded. In addition to the previous roll, there is a 1/30 chance to get heavily blinded for
(DL*10d10) turns, otherwise it's just (DLd4)+DL turns. If you pass, the corresponding attribute that influenced the roll is trained.

<tr><td>Flash trap<td>X is 0 if both the door's tile and the tile at the PC's position are lit, 10 if
only one is lit and 20 if both are unlit. If 1d30+X+1 &gt; (Pe+Luck), then you get blinded for (DLd4)+DL turns and Pe is abused by (-1-1d4). Otherwise, Pe is trained.
</table><p>

Players should get into the habit of never standing directly in front of a door when opening it
whenever possible. This will completely eliminate deaths from Stone block door traps and damage from
Trick doors. It also lessens the damage from an Explosive rune: "You partially evade the
explosion." As with ordinary traps, PCs with high Dexterity are more successful
at evading door traps: "Suddenly a huge rock drops directly in front of the door! You barely evade it by jumping
backwards!"<p>

If the PC has the Detect Traps skill, it is worth <tt>a</tt>pplying it a few times in the direction of
closed doors, or simple <tt>s</tt>earching can be used as well.<p>

Unlike regular traps, the type of a discovered trapped door cannot be recognized neither by a color -
it is always red, nor by looking around using <tt>l</tt>ook command. But it can be discovered by <tt>a</tt>pplying
the Detect Traps skill in the direction of a known trapped door. Or, via calculating door pattern -
see section 0.13.3.5 below.<p>

<a name="0d33"></a><h4>0.13.3.3 Secret doors</h4>
Some doors are hidden and must be <tt>s</tt>earched for. A ring of searching will do this automatically.
Dark Elves (5), Thieves (6), Orcs (10) and Dwarves (20) get bonus to finding secret doors.
Alternatively, secret doors may be discovered by <tt>k</tt>icking them. Kicking a normal dungeon wall results
in the message "You hurt your foot kicking the wall!". Kicking a concealed secret door results in the
message "You really hurt your foot kicking the wall!"<p>

<a name="0d34"></a><h4>0.13.3.4 Special door features</h4>
Closed doors can be kicked down for wooden sticks, which can then be used for Fletchery.
However, a destroyed door (either original or created) will leave an invisible doorstep,
which has the following properties:
<ul>
<li>Herbs won't grow on a spot where once door had existed.
<li>Wand of digging won't create a pit on such a square. You get "Nothing happens" message.
<li>You may dig a hole with a pick axe, and cover it with a blanket and create regular trap. And then you may disarm it - the doorstep is
still there. It doesn't matter if you disarm the trap with spell or with respective skill.
<li>Doorsteps aren't affected by wand of destruction. It doesn't make any difference if you destruct the door, or kick it down
and <tt>z</tt>ap the wand of destruction afterwards.
<li>Wand of trap creation will often recreate a trapped door on such a square, instead of regular trap.
</ul><p>

<a name="0d35"></a><h4>0.13.3.5 Door pattern</h4>
As with traps, door locks and door traps occur in a known pattern. Notice that door
keys and door traps have pattern of six, which leads to fact that all doors with same
key on same level can have only one trap type.<p>

The order, left to right or top to bottom, is:
<a name="0d311"></a><ul>
<li>Round lock - Stunning rune
<li>Triangular lock - Flash trap
<li>Hexagonal lock - Trick door trap
<li>Small lock - Booby trap
<li>Tiny lock - Stone block trap
<li>Square lock - Explosive rune
</ul><p>

The trap type holds for the entire Infinite Dungeon. For Caverns of Chaos, D:1 round doors
have Trick door traps. D:2 round doors have Booby traps, D:3 Stone blocks etc. For other
locations, door trap patterns have not yet been investigated.<p>

<a name="0d36"></a><h4>0.13.3.6 Monsters who can smash doors</h4>
The following is a list of monsters that can break doors:<br>
dragons and wyrms of all colors and sizes, ogres, giants, minotaurs, golems, titans,
slayers, turtles, balors and molochs of all types. Additionally:
annihilator, (big) casino guard, bulette, burly adventurer, cat lord,
caveman, chaos warlord, dark orc, Dorn Beast, dwarven (elite) guardian,
emperor lich, eternal guardian, giant boar, greater earth elemental,
lich king, old barbarian, orc butcher, revenant, sheriff, snake from beyond, stone statue,
undead chaos dwarven berserker, writhing mass of primal chaos.<p>

<a name="0d4"></a><h4>0.13.4 Rooms</h4>
<a name="0d41"></a><h4>0.13.4.1 Dark rooms</h4>
Dark rooms, and dark areas in general, are just that - dark. They are problematic since approaching
enemies can't be seen. It is also possible to inadvertantly kill a creature in a dark room. The
darkness can be permanently dispelled with the Light spell or a wand of light. A torch or an amulet
of light provides a temporary light source. If a doomed PC enters a dark room, there is a 1 in 1000
chance of being instakilled by a grue each turn. See section <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f5">0.15.5</a>
for more detailed information about darkness.<p>

<a name="0d42"></a><h4>0.13.4.2 Tension rooms</h4>
Tension rooms have 1/5 chance to be generated.<p>

Tension rooms are relatively small rooms filled with monsters. They always have doors that cause
the walls around them to crumble. This allows the monsters within to swarm the PC. They can be
filled with monsters of one type, two separate types or a variety of different monsters. Mixed
tension rooms in particular can contain out-of-depth monsters. Since the level message "You sense
a certain tension." is always associated with these rooms, the PC is forewarned. It is prudent
to find out what is in the tension room with a wand of monster detection, especially at deeper
dungeon levels. It is quite possible to be faced with a ghost king and ancient karmic dragon
simultaneously from such a room.<p>

PCs that are blinded by a trap whilst breaking into a tension room can still try to identify what 
monsters they are facing from the message generated, as this tends to usually relate to a sound or 
feeling rather than a sight:
<ul>
<li>a multitude of angry sounds: mixed tension room
<li>many squeaking sounds: rats
<li>yelping war cries: kobolds
<li>hoots and wails: hobgoblins and goblins
<li>orcish battle cries: orcs
<li>high-pitched grunts: gnolls
<li>many howling sounds: wolves
<li>an enormous stench of decay: lesser undead
<li>a flood of chilling terror: ghosts
<li>this shop seems to be deserted: mimics
</ul>

<a name="0d43"></a><h4>0.13.4.3 Threatening rooms</h4>
Threatening rooms have 1/8 chance to be generated if DL&gt;7.<p>

A new variant of tension rooms has appeared in ADOM 1.0.0+. The level message "You suddenly feel threatened."
is generated on levels containing these rooms. These rooms are similar to tension rooms, but are always
filled with a single type of monster. In addition, they do not have the crumbling walls feature of
tension rooms.<p>

<a name="0d44"></a><h4>0.13.4.4 Trap rooms</h4>
Trap rooms have 1/50 chance to be generated, or 1/10 if Doomed.<p>

If the message "You shudder" is created upon entering a new dungeon level, one of the rooms on that level
will have a trap on each square. Care should be taken to locate this room as soon as possible. Monsters
that don't fly or hover will activate the traps if they stumble in such a room. It is possible for a
threat room to be the same as the trap room. Watch the carnage.<p>

Special messages rooms are dungeon rooms with either a one-time effect on the PC or a permanent unique effect 
that affects the PC (or other monsters) as long as they remain on one of the tiles of the room. However some messages

<a name="0d6"></a><h4>0.13.6 Herbs <tt>"</tt></h4>
Herbs have 1/6 chance to be generated if DL>2, no altar, no forge. <p>

<a name="0d61"></a><h4>0.13.6.1 Herbs growth</h4>
Herb bushes are always found in the Big Room (level 6 of the Caverns of Chaos).
They grow according to Conway's Life rules. They are as follows:
<ul>
<li>If the bush has 0 or 1 neighboring bush, it will die in the next generation.
<li>If the bush has 2 or 3 neighboring bushes, it will survive through the next generation.
<li>If the bush has 4 neighboring bushes, it will die in the next generation.
<li>If an empty dungeon square has 3 neighboring bushes, a new bush will grow during the next generation.
<li>Births and deaths are simultaneous.
</ul>

ADOM adds to this: there are 1d1000 turns between generations. If a bush has two neighbors, it will
remain the same during the next generation.
If a bush has three neighbors, it will gain strength during the next generation. These
additions are important, since there are many stable patterns, but very few that will continue to
blossom over time. For instance the following patterns are stable:<p>
<pre>
                                       *     *
                                      * *   * *
                                      * *    *
                                       *
</pre>
but are quite useless as far as ADOM is concerned. Since none of the bushes has three neighbors,
once they reach a withered state they will never recover. The best pattern to create for farming
herbs in ADOM is a 2 x 2 square of herbs. This will remain alive indefinitely and generate more
herb blossoms every generation. It is also worth preserving a 1 x 3 pattern. This is a pattern
that oscillates between horizontal and vertical. Since two of the herb bushes are new each
generation and therefore unpicked, they will constantly be renewed. The danger with this pattern
is overharvesting. If one bush dies, they all die. The square 2 x 2 pattern does not have this
liability. If one (and only one) bush dies, it will be filled in the next generation.<p>

Herbs apparently require light to survive. A message "It's dark here! Some herb bushes full of
blossoms are growing here. The vegetation beneath your feet shrivels and suddenly is gone." has
been observed.<p>

Herbs can be generated on any dungeon level by <tt>U</tt>sing a potion of holy water on a dungeon
square, even for PCs without the Gardening skill. The success rate is 33%. Note that
while any dungeon level will work, only those levels which already had herbs will support
herb growth. In other words, herbs will not undergo the normal growth cycle unless the
dungeon level had indigenous herbs. Consequently, the PC should avoid creating herbs in this
manner unless the dungeon level already has herbs, unless it is a matter of life or death.
The exception is PCs that have the Gardening skill. <tt>A</tt>pplying the Gardening skill with herb
seeds causes a dungeon level to transform to an herb-sustaining state.<p>

Be sure to take advantage of the information below about creating especially desirable herbs.<p>

<a name="0d62"></a><h4>0.13.6.2 Picking herbs</h4>
The strength of a particular herb bush can be determined by <tt>a</tt>pplying Herbalism skill. Three
strengths are recognized: full of blossoms, strong, and withered. If is safe to pick up a herb
full of blossoms or strong, but a withered herb may disappear after next pick up.
There is Herbalism / 1d160 chance for the bush to not lower in status; so 3/8 of the time the bush will still go down at 100 Herbalism. The status of
the herb picked is determined as follows: if Herbalism &gt; 1d110 = Uncursed, THEN (only if it passed the first check) if Herbalism &gt; 1d140 = Blessed.
Level 18+ Farmers now have a 50% chance of anything cursed turning uncursed at this point, immediatelly followed by a 50% chance for
uncursed to become blessed. Non-farmers get about 65% blessed herbs, 26% uncursed, and 9% cursed at 100 Herbalism; level 18+ Farmers should get around 80.5% blessed,
15% uncursed, and 4.5% cursed.<p>

<a name="0d7"></a><h4>0.13.7 Shops</h4>
Shops have 1/4 chance to be generated for Merchants, 1/6 chance for others. Pickup items from shop freely (<tt>,</tt>, <tt>;</tt>, <tt>Ctrl-p</tt>), but don't forget to <tt>p</tt>ay for them.
Use <tt>:p</tt> to pay for all items. Press <tt>P</tt> to see how much gold you currently owe.
To sell, just <tt>d</tt>rop (or <tt>:d</tt>rop) your stuff to the shop floor. Check your purse with <tt>$</tt>.<p>

The <a href="adomman-R.html#R1">ADOM Manual</a> provides some basic information about shops.
Shops are rooms in the dungeons inhabited by shopkeepers and stocked with their wares. Shops can be
general stores selling a variety of items or specialty stores selling only one type of item. Shops
should always be entered and explored, since viewing the items in a shop permanently identifies them.<p>

Certain powerful items are less likely to be generated in shops. These include wand of wishing (8x),
scroll of chaos resistance (12x), ring of djinni summoning (5x), potion of cure corruption (6x), potion of gain
attributes (40x), potion of attribute (30x), potion of potential attribute (20x), potion of water (2x). <p>

Shopkeepers will restock their inventory if it is depleted or appears to be depleted. It is a good idea
to pick up everything in a shop and drop the unwanted items on one square. This gives the shopkeeper
room to restock. Note that it is necessary for a certain amount of game time to pass in order for a
shop to restock. PCs with sufficient Perception scores and Listening skill levels will hear a message
"You hear arcane mumbling." which means a depleted shop has been restocked.<p>

<a name="0d71"></a><h4>0.13.7.1 Guaranteed shops</h4>
There are five guaranteed shops in the game:
<ul>
<li>Munxip's food store in Terinyo - <a href="adomgb-1-2.html#126">1.2.6</a>
<li>Barnabas' general shop in Lawenilothehl - <a href="adomgb-1-3.html#132">1.3.2</a>
<li>Waldenbrook's general shop in Dwarftown - <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#351">3.5.1</a>
<li>Leggot's general shop in the High Mountain Village - <a href="adomgb-2-1.html#214">2.1.4</a>
<li>Great Gift Shoppe in the Casino - <a href="adomgb-3-13.html">3.13</a>
</ul><p>

Shopkeepers generally buy items as well as
selling them. The exception is the Casino shop, which only sells. Specialty storekeepers are only
interested in purchasing the items they specialize in. Sell Munxip those useless kobold corpses!<p>

<a name="0d72"><h4>0.13.7.2 Random shops</h4>
Other shops are found randomly in the dungeons. The following shop types may be randomly generated,
listed with their chance out of 20:<p>

<a name="0d721"><table border=1><caption>Shop types</caption>

<a name="0d73"></a><h4>0.13.7.3 Shopkeepers' racial prejudices</h4>
Shopkeepers have definite racial prejudices in addition to the special criteria Munxip (see sections
<a href="adomgb-1-2.html#122">1.2.2, 1.2.6</a>) and Barnabas (see sections <a href="adomgb-1-3.html#131">1.3.1, 1.3.2</a>)
use. Malte Helmert has done some testing
regarding this and observed the following: The HMV and Lawenilothehl shops were generated 50 times each.
The races of the shopkeepers were:
<ul>
<li>Barnabas: 15x Human, 14x Orc, 13x Troll, 8x Gnome
<li>Leggot: 18x Human, 14x Troll, 9x Gnome, 9x Dwarf
</ul><p>

Other races may be possible, with a very low probability.<p>

Quoting Malte's findings:<p>

"The following chart lists the percentage of the "base value" offered by a shopkeeper of the race
specified in the column to a PC of the race specified in the row. 100% is normal, 110% is possible
if the shopkeeper likes the PC's race very much (mostly if both are of the same race), and the value
can become as low as 10% if the shopkeeper really hates the PC's race.<p>

"Looking at the chart, you see that all non-Hurthling shopkeepers prefer PCs of the same race.
Hurthlings are the only shopkeeper race that isn't prejudiced, and Hurthlings are also the
best-liked PC race (there is no race that gives Hurthlings a really bad deal, and many give them
excellent deals).<p>

"Considering the fact that the most important shopkeeper in the game is a Dwarf (Waldenbrook),
Orcish and especially Dark Elven PCs appear to have the worst time (this is not news, of course)."<p>

<a name="0d74"></a><h4>0.13.7.4 Robbing shops</h4>
Shops can be robbed. This of course has effects on alignment, in addition to putting the PC's life at
risk. These shopkeepers are maintaining a business in a highly dangerous environment and are well
suited to dealing with those who choose to steal from them. In addition to their own very tough nature,
they can summon hordes of thugs who attack the PC. Shopkeepers are able to detect invisible PCs. The
message "-Shopkeeper- stares at your position with great intensity." indicates they have detected and
are looking at an invisible PC. However, this does not happen instantly. Therefore, invisibility can
be used to rob shops without making the shopkeeper hostile. The PC can enter a shop while invisible and
pick up items. Anything the invisible PC picks up <i>prior</i> to generation of the above message can be
taken from the shop safely. Therefore, the usual technique is to enter the shop while visible, gather
up everything in the shop and drop it all as close to the door as possible. The PC can then become
invisible, pick up everything and leave the shop undetected as long as the above message is not generated.<p>

Another technique for robbing shops is available for those PCs who have pets or slaves under good control.
If a shop is entered and nothing is picked up, the shopkeeper does not block the door. The PC can order
his pet or slave to stand in the doorway, pick up whatever is desired, then <tt>:s</tt>wap positions with the
pet or slave. At that point, getting away with the loot is simply a matter of outrunning the shopkeeper
and avoiding or killing any summoned thugs.<p>

A PC with the Teleportation spell can teleport a shopkeeper out of his shop. Shopkeepers are
teleportation resistant, so trying this with a wand is usually not successful and a waste of the wand's
charges. This results in a hostile shopkeeper and summoned thugs, however. Since it is impossible to
choose the destination of the shopkeeper, this is a dangerous technique unless the PC is experienced
enough to deal with a hostile shopkeeper and the thugs he will summon.<p>

A hostile shopkeeper can use his thrown coin attack only once.<p>

Note the following:

<li>the cursing penalty applies only to nonchaotic PCs
<li>if the PC is already cursed when the cursing penalty is to be applied, the PC is doomed instead
<li>no cursing or dooming occurs or thugs are summoned for repeated robbing (when the shopkeeper was calmed)
<li>killing anyone who is in a state of panic will cause the entire town to become hostile
</ul><p>

<a name="0d8"></a><h4>0.13.8 Rivers <tt>=</tt></h4>
Rivers have 1/15 chance to be generated.<p>

Introduced in gamma 14, these can be found in the High Kings cave, Puppy Cave, Druid Dungeon, CoC, ID, UD
(Rift?). Like any body of water, they can rust unprotected iron items, drench scrolls and spellbooks
and drown the PC. Drowning damage seems be dependent on HPs, with high-HP PCs taking proportionally more damage.
Precautions include waterproof blankets, a high Swimming skill, water breathing gear
(see section <a href="adomgb-0-12.html#0c17">0.12.1.7</a>), rustproofing iron items, casting Earthquake (ceiling rubble
can create land bridges), freezing the water (see next paragraph),
teleportation, trap creation (for teleportation trap), and Bridge Building.<p>

<a name="0d81"></a><h4>0.13.8.1 Freezing water</h4>
Pretty straightforward: use some cold source while standing next to
a water square and zap over it. Frost/Nether Bolt, Ice Ball/Freezing
Fury, or a wand of cold qualify. Ice is fragile, of course, and
there's a 2000 stone limit for your stuff's weight. Exploding ice
vortices will freeze all water in the range of their blast. Likewise,
monsters that cast Frost Bolt, ogre magi for instance, can freeze water.
However, monsters that breathe ice, white dragons for example, do not
freeze anything when their breath crosses water (probably a bug).<p>

<a name="0d9"></a><h4>0.13.9 Pools <tt>0</tt></h4>
Pools have 1/6 chance to be generated, if no altar, no forge, no herbs.<p>

<tt>D</tt>rinking from pools can do various magical things to a PC: one can gain or lose any intrinsic
(except water breathing, confusion and sickness resistance) or
unnatural aging. It is very possible to be corrupted by drinking from pools. Also, hostile snakes or
water elementals can come out of pools. The most hunted-for ability of pools is the small chance of
getting a wish. It has been rumored that pools with the color of the PC's eyes are the most beneficial.<p>

Strictly speaking, when a PC drinks from a pool there is a roll for 52 possible effects. The first two
effects listed ('pool dries up' and 'writhing with snakes') are much more common than the rest of the
effects and have a 8/52 and 5/52 chance, respectively. The other effects each have
a 1/52 chance.<p>

For the vast majority of the intrinsics are lost if a PC is having them and gained them if not
(intrinsic toggle). This makes pools much nicer for characters without many intrinsics already.
There is 1/104 chance to receive a wish (as long as PC is not doomed).
The pool inside the Stone Circle always corrupts by 10d100 CP's in addition to the normal effect.<p>

About six pools are guaranteed to be found in Darkforge.<p>

<a name="0da"></a><h4>0.13.10 Forges <tt>&</tt></h4>
Forges have 1/8 chance to be generated if DL>5.<p>

Forges are the basic pre-requisite for smithing - you also need an anvil, an
item to improve, a hammer and an ingot of the appropriate metal.
See <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f4">0.15.4</a> for more about Smithing.<p>

A forge is near-guaranteed to be found in the UD, and guaranteed places to
find some include Dwarftown and Darkforge.<p>

<a name="0db"></a><h4>0.13.11 Hives <tt>*</tt><tt>0</tt></h4>
Hives are holes in the floor of the dungeon containing hive creatures, either
ants or bees. Their population is finite. There is a guaranteed ant hive on
level two of the Puppy Cave, and a guaranteed bee hive before the Banshee level in CoC.<p>

<a name="0db1"></a><h4>0.13.11.1 Ants <tt>a</tt></h4>
Ant hives are filled with giant ant workers, giant ant warriors and a giant ant queen.
The player is alerted to an ant hive by hearing "clicking sounds".
They are simply a source of monsters to be killed with no particular reward
associated with clearing the hive. Bear in mind that ants dig. Leaving them
alone and allowing them to dig can be exploited as a source of rocks and possibly
gems. Ant corpses are sources of acid resistance.<p>

Huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills. When an ant attempts
to leave an anthill covered by a huge rock, the message "The uncursed huge rock
(-10, 10d6) seems to be shaking." is generated. Eventually the huge rock is
destroyed ("Something from below destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!")
and ants can come out of the hole again. Sometimes this happens after only a few
turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple huge rocks are destroyed
one after another and thus last longer than a single one.<p>

<a name="0db2"></a><h4>0.13.11.2 Bees <tt>b</tt></h4>
Bee hives are filled with giant bee workers, giant bee warriors and a giant bee queen.
The player is alerted by hearing "buzzing sounds".
They are a source of beeswax, which can be <tt>u</tt>sed to plug the PCs ears. This deafens
the PC and is one way to survive the Banshee level. A bee hive is guaranteed to be
generated before the Banshee's level. They are also a potential source of gelee
royal, which when eaten has a variety of beneficial effects: it is very nourishing,
heals, increases Appearance and cures poisoning. All of these beneficial effects
will not be experienced simultaneously, of course. Bees have a poisonous attack,
which kills the attacking bee. Kicking the hive will cause the bees to become
enraged and swarm the PC. Kicking the hive apparently increases the chance of
gelee royal generation, although it is not guaranteed. In ADOM 1.1.1,
bees generated by <tt>k</tt>icking the hive are considered summoned and therefore cannot be
sacrificed. This may well be a bug. Be careful of this if you are relying on an
altar to get rid of bees.<p>

<a name="0dc"></a><h4>0.13.12 Vaults</h4>
Vaults are large rooms, larger than tension rooms. Depending on the variety, they can
be nearly completely filled with monsters or only partially filled. They vary in
danger from moderate (a lesser vault full of gnolls and hyenas), a challenge for PCs
less than experience level ten, to absolutely deadly (a greater vault full of greater
undead), a challenge for experience level 50 PCs who have already won the game.<p>

<a name="0dc1"></a><h4>0.13.12.1 Lesser vaults</h4>
<a href="adomgb-0-13-lvaults.html">Examples of lesser vaults</a><p>

Lesser vaults generally take up about 1/4 of the screen with an 80 x 25 display. They
come in every imaginable flavor, from gnolls and hyenas to lesser undead to a variety
of berserkers. Their danger level is relatively low, comparable to a mixed tension room
on the same level. The level message "You feel excited." is always
generated when the PC enters a dungeon level containing a lesser vault.<p>

There is one guaranteed lesser vault, on level six of the Puppy Cave.<p>

<a name="0dc2"></a><h4>0.13.12.2 Greater vaults</h4>
<a href="adomgb-0-13-gvaults.html">Examples of greater vaults</a><p>

Greater vaults are unmistakable. They appear in the CoC beyond the wall of flames. They take up half of a standard dungeon level. The
level message "You feel truly excited." is always generated when the PC enters a dungeon
level containing a greater vault. It is wise to immediately <tt>z</tt>ap a wand of monster
detection to determine the type of vault. They come in a variety of types, including
fire creatures, giants, undead, and karmics. Greater undead and karmic greater vaults are particularly
challenging. Some players will simply ignore greater vaults of greater undead, even with
experience level 50 PCs. This is despite the fact that the rewards for clearing a greater
vault are considerable. They generally contain one or two artifacts along with substantial
amounts of gold, usually well over 100,000 gold pieces. This is in addition to any equipment
that the monsters might drop, which is considerable in the case of a greater vault full of
dragons. The amount of experience points available from clearing a greater vault is also
huge.<p>

PCs using good effectivity Frost Bolt or Fire Bolt generally have a fairly easy time clearing
fire- or cold-based creatures, respectively. However, these ranged spells also destroy some
of the equipment dropped by the monsters. High level Mindcrafters also have a relatively easy
time with greater vaults (as long as they are not undead!). Casting Confusion Wave followed
by (Greater) Mental Wave will clear a vault quickly, no muss, no fuss and no equipment
destruction. Clearing a greater vault with a pure fighter is much more tedious.<p>

There are no guaranteed greater vaults in the game.
<small>In v1.2.0, there is a guaranteed greater vault on D:45 or D:46.</small><p>

<table border=1><caption>Greater Vaults</caption>

<small>In v1.2.0, giants were buffed: hordes of ogre lords, hill giants, fomorian giants, and stone giants; many stone giant lords, frost giant jarls and fire giant kings; a few titans.</small><p>

<a name="0dd"></a><h4>0.13.13 Royal treasuries <tt>$</tt><tt>$</tt><tt>$</tt></h4>
Royal treasuries are small hidden rooms generally found in the upper parts of the CoC. Their
presence is indicated by the "You hear the steps of the royal guard." or "You hear the sound
of falling coins." level messages. They are disconnected from the rest of the rooms on the
level and thus can only be entered by tunneling or teleportation. Scroll of gold detection
can be used to identify the location of royal treasury. The royal guard within will
not be hostile towards PCs that simply pick up the gold. Attacking the royal guard is not
really worthwhile. It does not curse or doom, but is a chaotic act. Note that eating the
corpse of a royal guard curses the PC. Also note that chatting with the royal guard after picking
up some gold will make him hostile.<p>
<small>In v1.2+, the royal guardian will turn hostile if the PC picks any gold.</small>

<a name="0de"></a><h4>0.13.14 Altars <tt>_</tt></h4>
Altars have 1/9 chance to be generated.<p>

There are three types of altars: lawful, neutral, and chaotic. They can be used
to sacrifice items and monsters to the Gods. There is a guaranteed altar in Dwarftown.
There are also guaranteed chaotic altars in each of the elemental temples. Refer
to section <a href="adomgb-0-2.html#023">0.2.3</a> for a more complete
discussion about altars.<p>

<a name="0df"></a><h4>0.13.15 Graves <tt>+</tt></h4>
Graves are only found in two locations in the game: the Dwarven Graveyard (<a href="adomgb-2-7.html#271">2.7.1</a>),
and the CoC Graveyard (<a href="adomgb-3-8.html">3.8</a>).<p>

Most of the graves are not of much importance, but some of them will
contain the inscription "Great treasures are buried here." These
graves contain 1d10+5 items, other graves contain 1d6-4 (min 0) items.
It is indeed possible to find an outstanding item, up to and including
artifacts, but it is rare. Digging up graves is a chaotic act, which causes
an alignment drop of 100, and will always summon some kind of guardian.
The monsters that can spawn from a regular grave are chosen randomly
from the following: vampire, skeleton, skeletal warrior, corpse fiend,
mummy, greater mummy, lich, wraith, wight, ghul, zombie, spectre,
shadow, and ghost. For "great treasures" grave, there is 5/6 chance
for master lich, 5/36 chance for lich king, and 1/36 chance for the
dreaded emperor lich.<p>

Graves have a pattern, similar to that of traps or doors. The pattern is:
<ul>
<li>Great treasures are buried here.
<li>R.I.P.
<li>His steps were light, short his sight, great his pains, few his remains.
<li>Nameless stranger.
<li>R.I.P.
<li>J.F.K.
<li>R.I.P.
<li>May thy soul rest in peace.
<li>S.A.C.
<li>Unknown.
<li>He never was a valiant man, now he fits into a tiny can.
<li>R.I.P.
<li>Eternal pain be thine!
<li>R.I.P.
<li>V.D.
<li>Pelegar, 1162--1447
<li>R.I.P.
</ul><p>

The pattern shifts by three items to the left for next row, unlike traps/doors,
which shift just 1 item. It could be used by characters with low Literacy to find
great treasures graves. Reading graves probably trains Literacy a bit.<p>

All of this regarding digging graves assumes the PC has a means of digging. The available
methods are:
<ul>
<li>pickaxe - there is a guaranteed pickaxe in the Pyramid for PCs at experience
level 13 - 16 (see section <a href="adomgb-2-9.html">2.9</a>)
<li>wand of digging - direction <tt>5</tt>
<li>Mystic Shovel / Divine Digger spell - direction <tt>5</tt>
<li>failing to read a spellbook can sometimes dig grave - see  <a href="adomgb-0-5.html#0515">0.5.1.5</a>
</ul><p>

<a name="0dg"></a><h4>0.13.16 Cavernous levels</h4>
Cavernous levels are a particular type of level that features large circular rooms
occasionally interspersed with short connecting corridors. Cavernous levels tend to be
considerably more dangerous than normal levels because monster generation rate is much
faster, and it is easy to get surrounded. Most dungeon features cannot occur in cavernous
levels, the exceptions being altars, hives, surges of power and threat rooms, i.e.
rooms that happen to lack the actual walls holding the monsters in. In this form
they are much more dangerous than on normal levels: they feature a large (often 25-40)
number of levelled creatures of the same type that will engage the PC once spotted, and,
due to their large numbers, close proximity, and the open spaces, can be very difficult
to handle, particularly if the denizens of the open threat rooms are summoners, vortices,
or otherwise dangerous monsters such as diamond golems.<p>
Although the design of cavernous levels is not fixed (from their appearance, they are
probably modified regular levels), their locations generally are. The following is a list
of all cavernous levels in ADOM:<p>
<ul>
<li>the fifth level of the Puppy Cave
<li>levels 3-5 of the Tomb of the High Kings
<li>two levels of the Caverns of Chaos, typically around D:37 and D:44
<li>all levels of the Blue Dragon Caves
<li>all levels of the Scintillating Cave except for the last level
<li>the Big Room shares the main features of cavernous levels - wide open spaces and
high monster generation - but is not a proper cavernous level because of its fixed,
clearly non-natural size and shape and the guaranteed presence of herbs (to the
exclusion of other dungeon features)
</ul><p>

<a name="0dh"></a><h4>0.13.17 Webs <tt>|</tt></h4>
Webs are a semi-permanent dungeon feature that can trap either the PC or monsters imposing 
significant penalties on their actions. Webs are never randomly generated on levels - they 
can only be created either by the PC (the Web spell or a wand of webbing) or various spider-type monsters <tt>S</tt>. Each web occupies 
a single floor tile and will remain there indefinitely until it is destroyed. Webs can not 
be created on a tile already containing a herb plant or a trap - this can be used to create stable herb fams, and for trap detection. 
Webs likewise can not be created on non-dungeon floor tiles, staircases, doors, and over water.<p>

The PC will always be caught in a web whenever (s)he moves on a webbed floor tile either physically 
from neighboring tiles or by teleportation. While the PC is trapped in webs (s)he can not perform the 
majority of standard actions - typically the only thing to do is to try to break from webs (by moving in any direction). 
The chances of the PC to break from a web are dependent on his/her Strength score. Breaking from webs trains Strength, if it is lower than 15.
When the PC gets caught in webs and each time (s)he tries to break free and fails (s)he may got bitten by a swarm of 
tiny spiders. This will poison the PC if (s)he does not have poison resistance and will do nothing (except generate a 
corresponding message) otherwise. Dark elven PCs are immune to this poison and will instead "welcome his/her spidery friends".
After the PC breaks from webs on a floor tile they are destroyed.<p>

Monsters that move on a webbed floor tile have a chance to get caught. Trapped monsters will attempt to break free each turn 
and will be unable to move/attack the PC or use their abilities. It should be noted that monsters breaking free from webs 
will move/attack on the same turn. Various monsters simply ignore webs and will never be caught while moving on a webbed tile. 
These mainly include spider-type creatures, all dark elves, most constructs and undead.
Fire creatures and incredibly strong monsters (like molochs) will immediately destroy webs while moving on a webbed tile without 
losing a turn. The majority of monsters are, however, vulnerable to webs. It should be noted that due to the high chance to evade webbing shot 
from a wand or spell and the high chance to simply avoid being caught in the webs, using webs as a disabler requires 
preparations. The most efficient way to utilize webs is to fill a large area/long corridor completely, alert the monster to the PC's presence, 
teleport over the webbed tiles and resort to missile attacks while the monsters try to cover the "minefield". Due to the fact that 
monsters can break free from webs and move/attack the PC on the same turn using melee attacks is a risky tactic.<p>

Webs can be destroyed by fire/lightning/acid-based attacks performed by the PC and monsters, and likewise fire/lightning/acid vortices will 
immediately destroy any web that they move into. Webs will be destroyed on all levels of the Tower of Eternal Flames and in the Water Dragon Cave.<p>
