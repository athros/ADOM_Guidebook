<h3>Animated Forest and Dwarven Halls</h3>
Thrundarr asks the PC to pass through the Animated Forest and find out
what lies beyond. He also mentions a possibly dangerous shortcut which
turn out to be the Dwarven Halls DH: 1 and DH: 2. On approximately
D: 13 there will be a level that has two down staircases. One leads to
the Animated Forest, the other to the Dwarven Halls. It is impossible
to tell them apart.<p>

<a name="361"></a><h4>3.6.1 Animated Forest <tt>P</tt></h4>
<pre>Tree: Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 15, Hits: 68, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d8+5, Speed: 100.</pre>

Passing through the Animated Forest is a test of one's patience among
other things. The entire level is filled with living trees milling
about. The majority are not hostile but will of course become hostile
if attacked. It is difficult to get through them without accidentally
hitting one or more. When the PC encounters hostile trees it is best
not to try to fight them but rather keep moving. In fact it is usually
best to be as defensive as possible and forget about offense completely:
wield two shields and use Coward tactics. The hostile trees will
usually be left behind in the crowd. It seems to be best to keep moving
in any case and refrain from resting on one square. Invisibility is a
tremendous asset in the Animated Forest, but PCs usually do not have it
available at this stage of the game. Note that fireballs, from the wand
or spell, as well as the Burning Hands spell, should not be used in the
Animated Forest. While they are effective, the whole forest becomes
hostile. This generates too many hostile trees for a PC at this level
to cope with. Interestingly, fire bolts, from the spell or wand, are
also effective, but do not cause the forest to become hostile.
The trees do not see in Darkness, so that tactic can also be used.<p>

Summarizing the methods for crossing the forest:
<ul>
<li>Dual-wielding shields. This prevents the player from accidentally attacking
non-hostile trees, and provides extra DV/PV to reduce damage from the occasional hostile tree.
<small>In v1.2.0 casting spells is not allowed when dual wielding shields.</small>
<li>Invisibility. The trees cannot see invisible, so this (preferably combined with
dual-wielding shields) generally makes progress much quicker, since even hostile
trees will occasionally move and allow the PC to progress through the forest.
<li>Darkness. The trees cannot see in darkness, so it is possible to blanket the
entire level in darkness and fight through the trees with minimal risk. In theory,
panicked trees will be able to hit you if cornered; but it's hard to corner
anything in a wide open space. It does take a lot of time to go through the entire
level this way. <small>In v1.2.0, monsters that lack the ability to see in darkness will still try to attack.</small>
<li>Digging. There's just enough space behind the eastern and northern walls
that can be dug out to create a clear passageway around the forest. Close
it off using wands of door creation and avoid killing any trees henceforth,
to minimize the risk of trees showing up inside the hallway.
<li>Teleportation. Controlled teleportation will greatly shorten the time spent
to cross the forest. While the PC can try to teleport directly to the down stairs,
if this space is occupied (which is likely) this will teleport him to a random
spot on the level. This is not a bad thing if the PC has just entered the Forest
and is as far away from the opposite stairs as it gets, so it doesn't hurt to try.
Otherwise it might be more prudent to teleport from empty spot to empty spot until
the down staircases are in sight, and then teleport on them once they are vacated.
</ul><p>

<a name="362"></a><h4>3.6.2 Dwarven Halls</h4>
The alternative to the tedium of the Animated Forest is a descent through
the Dwarven Halls. This is much faster but potentially dangerous. Very
out-of-depth monsters can be generated in the Dwarven Halls.
Use scroll or wand of monster detection, if possible, upon entering each level
of the Dwarven Halls. This will allow you to immediately identify any dangerous
creatures, and make a judgment about whether or not the level is remotely safe
to explore. Furthermore, this will allow you to identify and avoid tension rooms.
If the PC has invisibility, seven league boots or anything that increases speed,
wear them before entering in case it becomes necessary to flee.
Exploring other than finding the down stairways is highly inadvisable.
Monsters that are probably too dangerous to tolerate include: balors, greater daemons,
black unicorns, white unicorns, lich kings, emperor lichs, chaos wizards, quickling queens,
diamond golems, ancient dragons, titans. Vortices spawned in DH can also do
immense amounts damage and must be dealt with carefully.<p>

Summarizing the useful items for the Dwarven Halls:
<ul>
<li>blessed scrolls of magic mapping to locate the stairs
<li>controlled teleportation
<li>scroll or wand of monster detection
<li>invisibility
<li>seven league boots
</ul><p>

<a name="363"></a><h4>3.6.3 Your choice</h4>
Both of these locations can be problematic. The Animated Forest is
always incredibly tedious. The Dwarven Halls can be a cakewalk if the
PC is lucky enough to have the stairways generated close together.
However, if the stairs are distant and the monsters dangerous,
it is probably advisable to abandon the Dwarven Halls entirely and
simply cross the Animated Forest. The Halls can also be a virtual
instadeath if a very nasty monster shows up. As Thrundarr says,
"It's yer choice."<p>
