<h3>Gremlin Cave</h3>
<pre>Gremlin: Level: 1, DV: 18, PV: 0, Hits: 8, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d3+1, Speed 100.</pre>
The Gremlin Cave is located in the southwest corner of the Drakalor Chain.
There are messages generated when the PC enters the Gremlin
Cave: "You feel watched. You shiver. You shiver really bad! It's dark
here!". The Gremlin Cave is dark and filled with water traps, which, when
triggered by the gremlins <tt>I</tt>, cause them to multiply. Things can get out of
control quickly in this cave due to the rapid replication of the gremlins.
The Disarm Traps spell or skill can be very valuable here - if the traps are taken out,
the gremlin hordes can be dealt with eventually.
The cave contains the Phial of Caladriel, which is an artifact potion.
<pre>
---------------------------- phial of Caladriel ----------------------------

Weight: 2s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2
points of damage.

(the phial of Caladriel uses up the PC's power points to generate light,
and blinds monsters when thrown except undead and constructs)
</pre>
The cave is also a source of fluff balls, which turn into gremlins when exposed to water,
and a climbing set. The objective is to retrieve the Phial of Caladriel and optionally the
climbing set. There is another guaranteed climbing set in the Pyramid
(section <a href="adomgb-2-9.html">2.9</a>). The Phial is located in the
farthest possible corner from the entrance.<p>

The cave is dark and gremlins are damaged by the Light spell, wands of
light, scrolls of light, crystals of light or by using the phial. An amulet of light,
a torch, adequate castings of the Light spell or many wands of light are necessary simply
to see and navigate the cave. If the PC is fairly buff,
the Gremlin Cave can be used to train weapon skills, since a potentially
infinite number of gremlins will be generated. The gremlins will eventually
become too experienced to contend with.<p>

Since there are a potentially endless number of gremlins available, it is
also possible to use the Pick Pockets skill indefinitely. This will both
train the skill and satisfy Yergius regarding the PC's proficiency as a
thief. Bear in mind also the always-present possibilty of pickpocketing a
truly outstanding item. While it is very rare, artifacts have been
pickpocketed this way.<p>

The fluff balls found here are portable "gremlin bombs" which have received
a lot of attention because of the possibility of pickpocketing indefinitely.
On exposure to water, they turn into a gremlin, which then multiplies from
the same water source. Bringing them underwater is interesting. ;-)<p>

Note that it is in no way necessary to enter this cave to complete the game.
It is simply a source of an expendable artifact which can be sacrificed,
given to the Demented Ratling or sold. The climbing set is also useful of
course, especially if the PC has missed the opportunity to enter the Pyramid.<p>
