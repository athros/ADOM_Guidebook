<a name="09"></a><h3>Monsters</h3>
The <a href="adomman-I.html">ADOM Manual</a> has a section about e<tt>x</tt>perience and
advancement, which is achieved mainly via <tt>:k</tt>illing monsters.
To see how much a neighbouring monster is injured, use <tt>:w</tt>. Another underused ability every PC has
is to <tt>:s</tt>wap positions with monster. However this mostly does not work with hostile monsters.
Press <tt>&amp;</tt> to access the monster memory.<p>

<a name="091"></a><h4>0.9.1 Significance of the first kill</h4>
Many new ADOM players are dismayed to find that they need to know what monster
their PC killed first. By the time they find this out, they have forgotten, of
course. Write it down, rename your PC to reflect your first kill, do anything
necessary to remember that first kill. It is very important, especially if you
are going to attempt an ultra ending.<p>

<a name="0911"></a><h4>0.9.1.1 Courage skill</h4>
There is a description of the Courage skill in the <a href="adomman-E.html#Courage">ADOM Manual</a>. It is
worthwhile to acquire it, although many players ignore it and have finished the
game without it. The skill is obtained by finishing the Old Barbarian's quest:
kill an additional score (20) of the monster your PC first killed. Note that
the Old Barbarian will not give the quest to PCs who have chaotic alignment.<p>

<a name="0912"></a><h4>0.9.1.2 Filk quest</h4>
The Filk quest is for very advanced players attempting an ultra ending. The
quest objective is to find and kill the named quickling bard Filk. He can be
found in the Infinite Dungeon on the level number corresponding to the number
of first-kill monsters the PC has killed. This will of course be a minimum
of 21 if the PC has acquired the Courage skill. It can also change during
the quest if the PC kills additional first-kill monsters after being assigned
the quest. See section <a href="adomgb-4.html#4311">4.3.1.1</a> for more about the Filk quest.<p>

<a name="0913"></a><h4>0.9.1.3 Strategy for the first kill: where and what?</h4>
There are many schools of thought on what the first kill should be. If the PC
wants to acquire the Courage skill quickly after being assigned the Old
Barbarian's quest, the monsters should be readily available. If the PC
also plans to do the Filk quest later in the game, the total number of
first-killed monsters killed must be minimized in order to prevent a tedious
and dangerous dive into the Infinite Dungeon. Some experienced players will
ignore the Old Barbarian's quest for the Courage skill. This makes it very
easy to complete the Filk quest, since if the player has chosen wisely the PC
will have killed only one of the monsters in question. Some players choose to
make the first kill in Lawenilothehl for this reason. Muggers, for instance,
are found only in Lawenilothehl and the Assassins' Guild. Skriek, the ratling
found in Lawenilothehl, is the only cloaked ratling in the game (although killing
him means the PC can no longer buy keys from him, which can save the PC's life).
Hotzenplotz, who is also located in Lawenilothehl, is the only crime lord in the
game. He is not easy for an experience level one PC to kill, but it can be done
with Wizards who have a good offensive bolt spell (not Magic Missile), or
Hurthling Archers who start the game with level five skill in thrown rocks.
Hotzenplotz's guardians Grunge and Munge are likewise the only two half-orc
bouncers in the game.<p>

If the PC wants the Courage skill and wants to attempt an ultra ending, the
following requirements must be met: the first kill must be a monster readily
available after receiving the Old Barbarian's quest; it must also be uncommon
in the various dungeons the PC will face so that the Filk quest does not get
out of control. Entering the Small Cave at the start of the game and killing
a rat, kobold or goblin as the first kill, for instance, makes it much more
difficult to finish an ultra ending.<p>

Beggars, goodwives, children, and farmers all make good, risk free first kills
(the alignment drop is pretty negligible). For the latter 3, you should lure
them out of Terinyo first. Also, if you're going for both Courage and the Filk
quest, outlaws are <i>excellent</i> first kills, since they're rare enough to avoid,
but can be easily generated on the road by the Pyramid, as well as being guaranteed
in Lawenilothehl.<p>

<a name="092"></a><h4>0.9.2 Cats <tt>f</tt> - the significance of felines</h4>
There are three types of monsters that count as cats in ADOM: cave lions, cave
tigers and wild cats.<p>

The Cat Lord resides on D: 35 in the Caverns of Chaos. He rewards PCs who have
avoided killing any cats with a powerful artifact ring. He will be hostile
towards PCs that have killed cats and becomes more powerful with each cat killed
(+10 HP for each cat killed, +1 level for each 25 cats killed, max level 20).<p>

Many players consider the Ring of the Master Cat to be the most powerful and
desirable ring in the game. It grants +16 to Dexterity and +16 to speed. In
addition it causes the PC to deliver considerably more critical hits with melee
and missile weapons and grants the Fate smiles intrinsic.<p>

It is important to remember that even after receiving the ring, the PC must not
kill any cats while wearing it, since it explodes in that circumstance. The
ring does not explode if it is in the backpack or left on another level when a
cat is killed after receiving the RotMC.<p>

Make no mistake about it, the requirement to kill no cats for the entire game is
a difficult one, causing many to refer to them as "those damn cats." The power
of the ring makes it worthwhile to attempt to avoid killing them.<p>

There are several ways to deal with cats. Teleportation is one, from a wand or
spell. Either teleport the cat away, especially if the PC does not have
teleport control, or teleport the PC. Potions of exchange thrown at a cat will
turn it into another monster. Potions of raw chaos, available at any time once
the PC has Moon Sickle, will turn cats into writhing masses of primal chaos when
thrown at cats. Cats can be led over traps until they are killed or turned into
a writhing mass of primal chaos. Luring a cat across an alarm trap causes other
monsters to become hostile and attack the cat. Note that in newer versions of
ADOM, the PC is charged with killing a cat if he creates or sets off a trap that
kills a cat. Wands of destruction can be used to safely kill cats since monsters
"destroyed" in this way do not appear in the kill list.<p>

PCs that are near Dwarftown can bring cats to Dwarftown and have the Priest, for
instance, kill them. This is probably a bit dangerous, since bringing hostile
monsters into Dwarftown repeatedly may eventually result in some of the
inhabitants becoming hostile. It should also be possible for PCs near the
Banshee's level to bring cats to her level and have her wail kill them.
Additional monsters that can be used include vortices. Lure a cat close enough
to one and allow it to explode. Be familiar with vortices before trying this.<p>

Companions can kill cats for you. Cave lions and wild cats can be tamed with
rat and/or giant rat corpses, if you have enough of them. Cave tigers can
eventually be tamed with pieces of fresh and/or raw meat, but it requires five
or more pieces. If the PC can become invisible, and has not attacked the cat in
question, it can simply be walked away from. Cats can be confused with the
Ventriloquism skill. While they are confused, run away. Cats can probably be
confused or blinded by throwing potions of confusion or blindness at them.
Again the run away tactic would be used.<p>

<a name="093"></a><h4>0.9.3 Karmic beings</h4>
Karmic monsters come in three main varieties: karmic lizards <tt>l</tt>,
(ancient) karmic (baby) dragons <tt>D</tt> and named great karmic wyrms <tt>W</tt>.
They can be identified by the fact that they change color with each turn.
Be very careful if the PC encounters a lizard
with the <tt>w</tt>alk command. It may allow the PC to wind up right next to the
lizard, in which case you may not have time to notice the color change.
Karmics demand caution because attacking them in melee causes the PC to lose
the Fate smiles intrinsic, then the Lucky intrinsic followed by cursing then
dooming if the PC continues. This is not a 100% guaranteed effect. PCs can
kill karmics in one hit and not suffer the consequences. However, it happens
so often that karmics should not be engaged in melee if it is possible to
avoid it. Killing them with magic, missiles, Mindcraft or companions is the
way to dispatch them. The changing color of karmics reflects the nature of
karmic dragons. They breathe not one element, like ordinary dragons, but have
<i>all</i> the breath attacks available, varying from turn to turn depending on
their color. This also means that they are immune to all elemental magical
attacks. Unfortunately karmic dragon scale mail is not available in the game.
;-) They are vulnerable to dragon slaying ammo.<p>

Three unique beings share the cursing/dooming property of karmics: Filk,
the quickling bard, the Oracle, and Sharad-Waador, the ancient karmic wyrm.<p>

Karmic beings will occasionally leave corpses when killed. Eating the corpse
of a karmic being will, in order, remove the Doomed intrinsic if present, remove
the Cursed intrinsic if present, grant the Lucky intrinsic if not present and
grant the Fate smiles intrinsic if not present. Remember all or any of these
intrinsics can be present simultaneously. Thus a PC that is Doomed and Lucky
would lose the Doomed intrinsic and retain the Lucky intrinsic after eating a
karmic corpse. The same is true for a PC that has the Cursed and Doomed
intrinsics - the PC would lose the Doomed intrinsic but not the Cursed intrinsic
and would not gain either the Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics.<p>

<a name="094"></a><h4>0.9.4 Monster types</h4>
Each monster is typically categorized based on attributes relating to the monster's race,
body type etc. Each monster shares certain attributes with other monsters in the same category,
usually including a common vulnerability to certain weapons (such as missiles "of -foo- slaying").
Such categories are commonly referred to as monster types, or mob types.
Listed below are all the known monster types in ADOM. Note that a number of known monsters
do not appear to belong to any of these categories; rather, their monster type can be said to
be "Unknown". Examples are eyes <tt>e</tt>, most fantastic beasts <tt>F</tt>, unicorns <tt>U</tt>,
mimics <tt>m</tt>, rust monsters <tt>R</tt>, will o'wisp <tt>*</tt>, and living wall <tt>#</tt>.
Furthermore, it is possible for a monster to fall into more than one category,
eg. golems are construct humanoids, skeletons, zombies, liches etc. are undead humanoids,
and Andor Drakon is a demonic humanoid.<p>

<a name="0941"></a><h4>0.9.4.1 Animals</h4>
Animals are a diverse mixture of semi-intelligent monsters, which usually can be affected by mindcraft
(with the exception of a few such as rabid dogs), but can't use equipment and tend not speak in a
comprehensible language. The monster class consists of several monsters
including bats <tt>B</tt>, natural beasts such as bears <tt>N</tt>, fantastic beasts <tt>F</tt>,
lizards <tt>l</tt>, snakes <tt>s</tt>, and worms <tt>w</tt>.<p>

Regarding animals:
<ul>
<li>There are no known weapons that slay all animals.
<li>Beastfighters attacking animals in unarmed melee have a greater chance of landing critical hits on them than against any other type of monsters.
<li>All animals can be calmed and eventually tamed by music.
<li>If the PC is a Druid, all animals in the game will be generated non-hostile. The main exception to this is in the evil druid Keethrax's lair in the Druid Dungeon.
<li>Additionally, if the PC is a Druid it is a major offence to their god(s) to sacrifice an animal.
</ul><p>

The following are animal subtypes:
<ul>
<li><b>Aquatics <tt>A</tt></b> - underwater cretures found in the Water Dragon Cave.
<li><b>Cats <tt>f</tt></b> - see section 0.9.2 above.
<li><b>Dogs <tt>d</tt></b> - can be tamed by <tt>g</tt>iving them bones.
<li><b>Rats <tt>r</tt></b> - the artifact weapon Cat's Claw slays them; they are potent swimmers.
<li><b>Insects </b> - ants <tt>a</tt>, bees <tt>b</tt>, centipedes <tt>c</tt>, and bugs <tt>i</tt> - artifact weapon ebony spear "Bugbiter" slays them all;
they are immune to mindcraft (except giant ant warrior, giant ant queen, giant bee queen, giant bee warrior and ankheg). Almost all insect corpses provide intrinsics 
or other special effects. They are also largely indigestible and cause the PC to vomit, losing satiation.
<li><b>Spiders <tt>S</tt></b> - are not classified as insects, but are a separate animal subtype.
Obviously, they are poisonous, and they ignore webs. Except tarantulas, spiders also spin webs.
<li><b>Rabbits <tt>r</tt></b> - they only appear on special Battle Bunny level, deep in the CoC. Rabbit knife slays them.
</ul><p>

<a name="0942"></a><h4>0.9.4.2 Constructs <tt>Y</tt></h4>
Constructs, or unlife, are insentient or semi-sentient monsters, that are damaged and destroyed by attacks rather than injured and killed.
The main types of monsters belonging to the construct/unlife category are golems <tt>Y</tt>, and construct humanoids such as gargoyles and margoyles <tt>I</tt>.
Vortices <tt>V</tt>, elementals <tt>E</tt>, grues <tt>x</tt>, and animated armors <tt>[</tt> are also constructs.<p>

Regarding constructs:<p>
<ul>
<li>Amulet of protection from constructs protects against their special attacks 60% / 80% / 120% of the time B/U/C. It does not protect against explosion of a vortex.
<li>Unlife slayers in the game include arrows/quarrels "of construct slaying"; and a small number of artifact weapons including Purifier and Vanquisher.
<li>Note that although the game most often uses the term "constructs" to refer to the monster type, weapons that slay constructs display the
line "It is an unlife slayer." when Greater Identify is applied to them.
<li>Mindcraft and stethoscopes can not be used on constructs.
<li>They never panic or become enraged.
</ul><p>

<a name="0943"></a><h4>0.9.4.3 Demons <tt>&</tt></h4>
Demons are uncommon monsters that include some of the most powerful monsters in the game.
Apart from molochs and least daemons, most demons have corrupting attacks and/or magical powers such as an elemental breath weapon.
Almost all members of the demon monster type are represented by the <tt>&</tt> symbol; though some monsters such as grues <tt>x</tt>,
imps and quasits <tt>I</tt>, and chaos knights <tt>h</tt> also belong to the group. The category includes all elemental demons, molochs,
greater molochs, balors, greater demons; and all the fearsome artifact guardians, the Emperor Moloch, the Greater Balor, and Andor Drakon.<p>

Demons are vulnerable to the aptly named arrows/quarrels of demon slaying. Additionally, several artifact weapons in the game slay demons:
the Trident of the Red Rooster, the Rune-covered Trident, Executor, Purifier and Vanquisher. Furthermore, blessed weapons deal 1.5 times
their base damage to demons.<p>

<a name="0944"></a><h4>0.9.4.4 Dragons <tt>D</tt></h4>
This monster type consists solely of monsters represented by the letter <tt>D</tt> or <tt>W</tt> - dragons and wyrms. All dragons have breath attacks,
whilst wyrms have extra magical attacks too. Nearly all dragons are associated with an element; with the exception of karmic dragons (which harness
all elements), water dragons (water isn't an element in the game, per se), and shadow wyrms (which harness undead powers). Also, most dragons are
chaotic, with the exception of Sharad-Waador and the water dragons.<p>

Regarding dragons:
<ul>
<li>They are vulnerable to any weapon (greater) identified as "a dragon slayer". These include arrows/quarrels of dragon slaying,
and the artifact weapons Wyrmlance and Vanquisher.
<li>A number of dragons yield a small alignment boost when killed. Of course, this only includes dragons that are chaotic
to begin with, and does not include baby dragons.
<li>Colored dragons and wyrms can be enraged by giving them a dragon-hide item that is the same color as them.
They will also instantly destroy the item. There is, of course, usually very little reason to actually do this.
Due to a bug black and white dragons react to the opposite color when you give them items like this, instead of their own.
<li>Dragons have a unique characteristic when killed: a dragon that has picked up gold pieces will drop twice as many
when killed, in addition to whatever gold and other treasure it may have been
carrying. This is probably a bug and can obviously be used to multiply the
PC's gold potentially indefinitely once he is buff enough to dispatch dragons.
There is some risk involved since many types of dragons can destroy entire
heaps of gold with their breath attacks.
Note that the amount of gold in a single stack is limited to a 32-bit integer
(2<sup>31</sup> - 1 or 2,147,483,647). Generating larger stacks will cause errors.
</ul><p>

<a name="0945"></a><h4>0.9.4.5 Giants <tt>H</tt></h4>
Interestingly, various monsters whose name begins with the "giant" adjective are <i>not</i> giants at all -
such as giant rat, giant rust monster etc. On the other hand, monsters with "giant" not as the first word are
in fact giants - such as hill giant, fire giant king or frost giant jarl.
Giants also include titans, cyclops, and the ettin <tt>O</tt>. As one can imagine, great physical strength is of
course a common attribute amongst giants, as is their corresponding ability to grant the PC some extra Strength when eaten.
Also, most giants use missile weapons. When a titan (or moloch) is approaching, you will hear "*THUMB*". Weapons
which slay giants are only arrow/quarrel of giant slaying, Grod and Vanquisher.<p>

<a name="0946"></a><h4>0.9.4.6 Humanoids <tt>@</tt></h4>
Humanoids are a diverse class of monsters that are at least semi-intelligent, capable of some sort of speech,
and know how to equip, use, and throw items. Construct humanoids (golems) are an exception. Humanoids make up
the largest group of monsters; making humanoid slaying weapons particularly desirable.
The monster class consists of several monsters including humans <tt>@</tt>, small humanoids <tt>h</tt>,
grungy humanoids <tt>g</tt> (goblins, hobgoblins, gnolls, bugbears), imps <tt>I</tt>, orcs <tt>o</tt>, ogres <tt>O</tt>, pixies and quicklings <tt>p</tt>,
minotaurs <tt>M</tt>, ratlings <tt>r</tt>, kobolds <tt>k</tt>, berserkers and barbarians <tt>K</tt>, townsfolk <tt>t</tt>, trolls <tt>T</tt>,
giant humanoids <tt>H</tt>, extraplanar beings <tt>X</tt>, underdark beings <tt>u</tt>, chaos creatures <tt>C</tt>, werebeasts, and also most demons <tt>&</tt>.<p>

Regarding humanoids:
<ul>
<li>Arrows and quarrels of humanoid slaying exists, along with Kinslayer, Skullcrusher, Serpent's Bite, Executor and Vanquisher.
<li>Humanoids can be <tt>C</tt>hatted with, and are capable of using items in a number of ways.
<li>Humanoids can be pickpocketed.
<li>They are vulnerable to Mindcraft.
</ul><p>

<a name="0947"></a><h4>0.9.4.7 Jellies <tt>j</tt></h4>
Jellies can be troublesome in the early game due to several of their attacks -
sickness, corrosion, poison, confusion, paralyzation. Gray oozes and ochre jellies will corrode
weapons made of iron, mithril and adamantium or damage the PC with their acidic attacks
when fighting unarmed. Gloves will be immediately destroyed. Mithril and adamantium
weapons are more resistant to corrosion, but it will happen eventually - do not attempt
to clear a jelly pit in melee with weapons made of iron (especially), mithril or adamantium.
This can be problematic for a low level PC. Spells or missiles are preferable, but if a
low level PC must melee these critters, stone weapons are a good choice since they do not
corrode. Alternatively, the PC can wield a si and bash the jelly with it. As an artifact,
the si cannot be damaged. PCs that are acid resistant will take no damage unarmed.<p>

Gelatinous cubes can be particularly annoying because of their ability
to destroy items that are lying on the ground. Losing that waterproof
blanket in the SMC to one of these ugly blobs is extremely frustrating.
Easily killed with missiles, spells and mindcraft.<p>

One of the nastier jellies is the stone ooze. The paralysis attack of
these can be very, very nasty for PCs who have no means of paralyzation
resistance (such as an amulet of free action). Attack them from a
distance or run away.<p>

Here is the list of all jellies and their specialties:
<ul>
<li>death ooze, yellow ooze - poisons, regeneration
<li>gelatinous cube - paralyzes, dissolves items on ground
<li>gibbering mouther - confuses
<li>gray ooze, ochre jelly - breeder, corrodes weapons (or hands, gloves, boots)
<li>green blob, green slime - breeder, sickens
<li>stone ooze - paralyzes, bypasses PV
<li>writhing mass of primal chaos - corrupts, slows; very dangerous for low level PCs
</ul><p>

Apart from arrows and quarrels of jelly slaying, only Soaker and Vanquisher slay jellies.<p>

<a name="0948"></a><h4>0.9.4.8 Plants <tt>P</tt></h4>
Apart from animated trees in the Animated Forest, and the shambling mound, also green blob and green slime are considered plants.
PC cannot use <tt>:s</tt> command to swap places with them (even Monks and Beastfighters using their class powers).
When killed, animated trees often drop logs, usable in Bridge Building and Fletchery.
Regular trees <tt>T</tt> are probably plants as well, however they can't be attacked. Though
you may extract logs from them by <tt>U</tt>sing a hatchet on them. Be wary that chopping trees is
very long process, which is shortened by the Woodcraft skill. It is rumored that <tt>h</tt>andling trees may yield treasure if one is persistent enough.<p>
There are no arrows or quarrels of plant slaying. The two artifact weapons which slay plants are
Scorched Spear and Black Thumb.<p>

<a name="0949"></a><h4>0.9.4.9 Undead <tt>Z</tt></h4>
Undead are a class of monsters consisting of reanimated corpses and spirits. They can be created
by PC Necromancers using Necromancy, summoned by NPC Necromancers, or found randomly.
The Dwarven Graveyard and the more generic, CoC Graveyard both feature massive numbers of undead.
You can find even yet more undead by digging up the graves in a graveyard.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Undead powers</caption>
<tr><th>Undead    <th>Special attack  <th>Other notes

</table><p>
[1] Regular liches are also vulnerable to fire.<p>

Skeletons: skeleton <tt>z</tt>, skeletal warrior, skeletal king <tt>Z</tt><br>
Zombies: zombie <tt>z</tt>, steel zombie <tt>Y</tt><br>
Ghuls: ghul <tt>z</tt><br>
Ghosts: ghost, ghost lord, ghost king <tt>G</tt>, ghost bat <tt>B</tt><br>
Liches: lich, lich king, master lich, emperor lich <tt>L</tt><br>
Mummies: mummy, greater mummy, revenant <tt>Z</tt>, corpse fiend <tt>z</tt><br>
Shadows: shadow, shadow lord, slow shadow <tt>G</tt>, shadow troll <tt>T</tt>, shadow centipede <tt>c</tt><br>
Spirits: spectre, wraight <tt>G</tt>, vampire, wight <tt>Z</tt><p>

Regarding undead:
<ul>
<li>All undead can attack in the dark.
<li>Liches, mummies, the Banshee and Griff Bloodax can see invisible.
<li>Amulet of protection from undead protects against their special attacks 60% / 80% / 120% of the time B/U/C.
<li>Necromancers level 6 and Paladins level 40 get some resistances against undead attacks, especially attribute drain and paralyzation.
<li>Paladins and Priests have the ability to turn undead, when they are in good standing with their deity.
When turned, any affected undead will become scared and attempt to flee. Holding a holy symbol and <tt>U</tt>sing it will accomplish
the same thing, but this costs a small amount of piety. Level 40 Priests can instantly destroy undead, through a class power.
<li>Weapons with the suffix of the sun will do double damage to the undead. Blessed items will similarly inflict +50% damage on undead
(and demons). Finally, slaying weapons and ammunition that slay undead will get an automatic critical hit. A mace of disruption is
a non-artifact undead slayer.
<li>Destroy Undead spell, as one might imagine, inflicts decent damage on undead. Healing spells damage the undead instead of healing them,
thus allowing Healers (and others lacking more offensive spells) an additional opportunity. Likewise, Bless spell causes damage to undead
instead of standard effect. Thrown (or wielded) potions of holy water also work.
<li>Mindcrafters are warned to never use their mind-damaging powers against the undead, as the experience causes a backlash, harming
the Mindcrafter. At level 50, they receive only half of this damage. Note that telekinetic powers (Telekinetic Blast and Greater
Telekinetic Blast) are safe to use against undead as they do not cause backlash damage. Undead are also not visible for Eyes of the Mind.
</ul><p>

<a name="095"></a><h4>0.9.5 Strategies for dealing with particularly annoying monsters</h4>
Suggestions for more annoying monsters are welcome. No uniques, though -
they are dealt with in the section pertaining to their location.<p>

This section is about <i>annoying</i> monsters. Not necessarily very dangerous
or life-threatening, just monsters that are your personal pet peeve with some
attack or characteristic that infuriates you.<p>

<a name="0951"></a><h4>0.9.5.1 Early game</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>claw bugs <tt>i</tt></b> - Since claw bugs always ignore PV (luckily, they never damage
armor) and there are almost no wearable items substantially
increasing DV at this point in the game, fighting them in true
berserker mode - wearing nothing and switching tactics to berserker
(see section <a href="adomgb-0-7.html#074">0.7.4</a>) might be worthwhile.
In this mode, there are good bonuses to to-hit and to-damage values - usually enough to take
them out in one hit. Of course, this is not necessary once the PC
has some missiles and/or spells to take them out. Note that claw
bugs are immune to mindcraft as are all insects. They are very
fragile and pose a threat only due to their numerous (8 per turn!)
armor-punching attacks.<p>

<li><b>ghuls <tt>z</tt></b> - They are only dangerous because of their paralyzation ability.
Otherwise easy to kill. PCs with halfway decent DV should not have a problem.<p>

<li><b>jellies <tt>j</tt></b> - Refer to section 0.9.4.7 above.<p>

<li><b>karmic lizards <tt>l</tt></b> - See the section 0.9.3 above.<p>

<li><b>pixies <tt>p</tt></b> - These have an annoying habbit to steal most of the gold
your PC is carrying, then teleport away. Wear money belt to prevent stealing.
They are not dangerous otherwise.<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0952"></a><h4>0.9.5.2 Midgame</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>worms <tt>w</tt></b> - Worms are a group of breeding monsters of various colors that may
pose significant annoyance and even danger to the PC. Their main threat is that they
multiply very quickly and, if killed in large numbers, tend to become significantly
stronger - see <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#097">0.9.7</a>.<p>

The following is a quick overview of the worms in the game and the abilities they possess:
<ul>
<li>red worms: can breathe low-damage fire which may destroy items, immune to fire
<li>white worms: nothing remarkable
<li>green worms: may cause sickness
<li>brown worms: may cause paralysis
<li>purple worms: may cause poison
</ul><p>

<li><b>eyes <tt>e</tt></b> - One should slow down when an eye is encountered. These floating little
beings can prove quite troublesome, especially for PCs with low Willpower and without confusion resistance.
They generally have only 90 speed and thus can be outrunned. Also they have relatively low HP and
don't cause too much damage - the main threat is their special attack which may leave the PC vulnerable for an attack
of more powerful monsters, so a good strategy is dealing with them when they are alone. All eyes ignore water.<p>

The following is a quick overview of the eyes in the game and the abilities they possess:
<ul>
<li>staring eyes: may cause confusion
<li>chaos eyes: may cause corruption
<li>floating eyes: may cause paralysis
<li>magebane and magedoom eyes: may cause confusion, drain PP
<li>eyes of destruction: may destroy worn items and cause confusion, shrug off bolts often
</ul><p>

<li><b>dark elven priestesses/princesses <tt>u</tt></b>
- These monsters, nicknamed "spider factories," have the following nasty traits:
they summon spiders (poisoning monsters with high DV and PV that quickly gets even higher) quickly and in large numbers,
they occasionally shoot energy bolts and they are highly magic resistant. Priestesses also have a corrupting hit and
can paralyze in melee. Spiders (like all animals) can't open doors. If you can put closed doors between you and all the exits the spiders
can use, you'll be protected until something else wades through them and opens them. You may also need to seek ways
to slow the spiders (Slow Monster, stunning, paralyzation, confusion, Ventriloquism, etc.) so you can actually
close the door. Spider corpses poison you shortly, but grant permanent poison resistance. Eat one as soon as you find one and can
get a breather. Obviously bolt spells/wands are good against the spiders, though early characters often have too few PP/charges to
use them easily for the task. Try to zap the summoner along with the summoned. In the rare cases where they don't
resist, they tend to die quickly - they have low HP.<p>

<li><b>dopplegangers <tt>@</tt></b> - These are frustrating because they deflect missiles and cause
confusion. Doppleganger lords are somewhat more dangerous. Doppleganger kings are
exceptionally dangerous even for very experienced PCs: they reflect the nature of the PC
exactly in terms of DV and PV and may inflict substantially more damage than the PC is
capable of dealing. Their speed is also nearly identical to the PC's although movement
cost and hitpoints are not copied. Normal dopplegangers are easily killed with spells
or mindcraft. All dopplegangers share an inherent weakness: they are helpless in the
dark. If the PC can create darkness, from the spell, the scroll or the crystal,
dopplegangers are easily killed in melee.<p>

<li><b>Dorn Beasts <tt>F</tt></b> - Annoying because of their constant paralysis attack. An amulet of
free action will solve this problem. Less well known is the tactic
of attacking them in darkness or while blind. A recent report
suggests attacking them with missiles. Their paralysis attack does
not seem to engage when using missile weapons.<p>

<li><b>invisible stalkers <tt>@</tt></b> - They are what their name implies: invisible. You won't know
what is attacking, only after it is killed you will find an invisible stalker in the kill list.
Unless the PC has the See Invisible intrinsic of course. The message "You feel something
passing very closely besides your head!" or "Something hits you!" means an invisible monster just attacked
and possibly hit the PC. If the PC moves into an invisible monster, you get either "You swing at the air!" or
"You hit something!" message. Besides invisible stalkers, only ogre magi and some uniques will cast Invisibility
on themselves, but no other monster has intrinsic invisibility.
Fighting these in a corridor would be a good tactic if the PC does not have access to the See Invisible intrinsic.<p>

<li><b>mimics <tt>m</tt></b> - These annoying creatures can appear in a shop when the player is
least expecting it (although they do not seem to show up in
Terinyo or Lawenilothehl, thankfully, they <i>do</i> appear in the HMV
shop - a warning for players that elect to descend through the UD
to start the game). By the time the PC encounters them, they can
generally be killed; they are simply surprising and startling.
One is almost guaranteed in Waldenbrook's shop. Note that tension
rooms full of mimics, master mimics and mimic hiveminds are much
more dangerous than a single mimic in a shop. They have a paralyzing hit. <p>

<li><b>ogre magi <tt>O</tt></b> - See the section on invisible stalkers above. On the top of being invisible most
of the time, ogre magi also posses moderately powerful ice based ranged attack. Have See Invisible intrinsic,
cold resistance, a ring of fire equipped, and the PC should have no problem dispatching ogre magi.<p>

<li><b>ratling duelists <tt>r</tt></b> - Very annoying in melee thanks to their disarm ability. Have at least weapon mastery
 or use missiles/magic, if you want to avoid dropping your primary weapon.
You will continue fighting unarmed if not paying attention.
Alternatively, non-standard weapons (say, a statue) cannot be disarmed.
Ratling duelists and especially later, ratling fencers and warlords, are not to be underestimated. They are fast, dodge attacks
often, and have multiple attacks which ignore PV. Ratling duelists always drop gauntlets when killed.<p>

<li><b>rust monsters <tt>R</tt></b> - These beasts will rust the PC's vulnerable armor and weapons.
Extremely annoying, since all they have to do is touch the PC and
a perfectly functioning sword of sharpness or phase dagger can be
reduced to a useless hunk of metal. They can be pacified by
throwing metal items at them. Quarrels are a good choice if the
PC has some expendable ones. Their brethren, large rust monsters
and giant rust monsters, unfortunately cannot be pacified in this
way.<p>

<li><b>vampires <tt>Z</tt></b> - Vampires can be annoying due their ability to drain Strength and
Toughness. They hit quite often. Again, missiles or magic is preferable.<p>

<li><b>vortices <tt>V</tt></b> - There are four types: fire, ice, acid and lightning. All will explode when
near the PC and always do a significant damage, both to the PC's HP and
equipment - regardless of DV and PV. On encounter, equip the PC with the appropriate
resistance if possible. Fire and ice vortices are efficiently
dispatched by cold based or fire based spells respectively. Killing them from
distance or in one hit is recommended,	though it may not be easy to achieve.
Being at full HP is as well recommended strategy. Darkness could be very useful,
since it seems vortices won't explode in darkness.<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0953"></a><h4>0.9.5.3 Late game</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>annihilators <tt>C</tt></b> - Can destroy your precious eternium gear in no time.<p>

<li><b>gorgons <tt>F</tt></b> - These are very dangerous because of their petrifying attack. By the way,
petrification means death. Do not eat a gorgon's corpse unless the PC is wearing an amulet of petrification
resistance! (or has petrification resistance intrinsic). High DV allows the PC to avoid gorgon's breath.<p>

<li><b>emperor lichs <tt>L</tt></b> - Emperor lichs are trouble. An exception to the general rule in
this section, these annoying monsters are quite capable of killing
a PC quickly. They cast Death Ray, so resistance is essential.
They see invisible, are attribute drainers and are summoners. A group
of emperor lichs, such as those found in greater undead vaults, is
a challenge even for level 50 PCs who have won the game. They are
vulnerable to high effectivity fire spells. Improved Fireball
with effectivity +20 or more and Willpower 48 or greater is a
spellcaster PC's friend against emperor lichs.<p>

<li><b>molochs <tt>&</tt></b> - Molochs, and their larger brethren greater molochs, are a significant
threat. Their melee attack can be for 100 HP or significantly more
in the case of GMs. They fall into the annoying category because it
is possible to run away from them with any PC that has halfway decent
speed. They typically have a speed in the 60-70 range.<p>

<li><b>quicklings <tt>p</tt></b> - In addition to punching through armor, all quicklings and are very, very fast. Regular quicklings and quickling
queens will employ hit and run tactic.
Quickling lords and kings use dark elven quarrels. They all try to avoid bolt spells by returning to a position where they cannot be hit, if possible.
Quickling kings and queens see invisible. Quickling queens have very strong poison attack, so it may be necessary to deal with poison damage
even if the PC has poison resistance. All quicklings regenerate health. Since they try to avoid melee and bolt magic, they are most easily
killed with missiles, or in a corridor.<p>

<li><b>titans <tt>H</tt></b> - Titans and greater titans are very powerful late game monsters. They have excellent health, defense, damage output and speed.
They shoot eternium quarrels. They see invisible. A threat room full of titans could prove a significant challenge to
even the most advanced PCs. Do not compare these to giants or ogres. Titans are <i>much</i> stronger.<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0954"></a><h4>0.9.5.4 General strategies</h4>
If you cannot win a fair fight and you also cannot retreat - either the way is blocked or the monster is faster, not everything is lost. There might be a way to
disable your opponent somehow, helping you win the fight. The means to do so are detailed in the below table, listed approximately from weakest to strongest.
Note potions have to be thrown at your opponent, not drunk.<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Disability  <th>Means                            <th>Effect on monster   <th>Notes
<tr><td>Webs        <td>Web spell, wand of webbing       <td>no move             <td>does not work on large opponents and spiders; often does not work at all
<tr><td>Poison      <td>potion of poison [1], wand of poison <td>damage          <td>does not work on undead and constructs
<tr><td>Stunning    <td>Stun Ray spell, wand of stunning [3] <td>wander aimlessly; -4 to hit  <td>shrugged often, short duration
<tr><td>Sickness    <td>potion of sickness               <td>damage; reduced attack damage<td>does not work on undead and constructs; good duration
<tr><td>Confusion   <td>potion of confusion, potion of wonder <td>wander aimlessly<td>very useful, works on everyone [2]; usually lasts longer than stunning
<tr><td>Blindness   <td>potion of blindness, cursed potion of invisibility <td>wander aimlessly; -4 to hit<td>very useful, works on everyone [2]; lasts longest
<tr><td>Paralyzation<td>wand of paralyzation             <td>cannot do anything<td>most useful, works on everyone [2] unless shrugged
<tr><td>Disable     <td>potion of cure corruption        <td>disable special attacks + damage <td>most useful on monsters with corrupting hit and uniques
</table><p>
[1] Potion of poison can also be used to poison a weapon. The weapon then stays poisoned for several attacks.<p>
[2] Everyone including the ElDeR cHaOs GoD!<p>
[3] Thrown potions of cure poison will stun monsters with poisonous attacks, with 100 percent effectivity, except revenants which are undead and cannot be stunned.<p> 

Other means include teleporting away (you or the opp), the Scare Monster spell, exchanging the opp via thrown potion of exchange, or pacifying it via Calm Monster spell,
thrown potion of balance, berzio potion or Music skill where applicable. Wands of destruction, wands of earthquakes or the Earthquake spell can also
be used in dire situations. Remember darkness and/or invisibility often can be your friends, too.<p>

<a name="096"></a><h4>0.9.6 Weapon status - blessed, uncursed, cursed</h4>
As previously noted, the damage inflicted on an opponent that falls into the demon or undead monster type is
dependent on the weapon's blessed vs uncursed vs cursed status. The formulae are as follows:
<ul>
<li>for blessed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.5) - PV
<li>for uncursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.0) - PV
<li>for cursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 0.5) - PV
</ul><p>

Cursed weapons also seem to be more prone to breakage. Blessed weapons seem to be less prone to breakage.<p>

<a name="097"></a><h4>0.9.7 Monsters gain experience level - the uberjackal effect</h4>
Monsters gain xp level when the PC is killing them. It means if you manage to
kill a number of rats, the next generated rat will have higher xp level. Rarer
creatures require fewer kills to raise their xp level, a minimum is 5. For
example, orcs require 75 kills, rats and giant rats 50 kills, jackals 12 kills - avoid killing lots of those by any means! Exceptions are breeders, who never gain xp. Monsters gain:
<ul>
<li>PV +2 per 3 levels
<li>DV +1 per 5 levels
<li>number of attacks +1 per 10 levels
<li>damage +1 per 3 levels
<li>random HP increase proportional to level
</ul><p>

<a name="098"></a><h4>0.9.8 Gaining experience</h4>
High Learning increases experience gains. For every 1 xp gained (remainders are accounted for exactly,
there is no rounding loss), the PC gains Le/1000 bonus xp.
The Good Learner and Great Learner talents increase xp too. Good Learner alone is 150%, Good Learner + Great Learner is 120%.
Remainders are accounted for incorrectly and there is rounding loss for many small kills.<p>

The experience gained per killing a monster is dependent on Speed of both combatants according to the following formula:<p>
Exp_gained = base_exp * (monster_speed / PC_speed)<p>

This means lowering PC's speed as well as increasing monster speed before delivering the final hit are means of generating
more experience. This is most commonly achieved by repeatedly casting Slow Monster spell at the PC.
Beware however, there is a limit on maximum xp gain. Going beyond the limit will yield only 1 xp.<p>

Besides killing monsters, experience can be gained via disarming traps. A fraction experience (1/20) is gained
when offering piece and when sacrificing monsters at an altar. There is no other known way of gaining experience.<p>

<a name="0981"></a><h4>0.9.8.1 Shambling mounds <tt>P</tt></h4>
These guys love lightning. Any lightning damage increases their maximum HP by the damage amount.
Note it still damages them, only their maximum HP gets increased. PCs with some lightning spell and
some healing spell can make uber mounds rather quickly. They can then be dispatched via darkness
or invisibility for large xp amount.<p>

<a name="099"></a><h4>0.9.9 Spellcasting monsters</h4>
Not only the PC, but also some monsters are able to cast spells. However, the spell
selection for monsters is very different, as is monster spell mechanics.
Spellcasting monsters do not use the PP and spell knowledge/power system PC uses.
There are three classes of monster spells: directed spells, touch attack spells,
and non-directed spells, and two monster spellcaster's properties: spell range and
spell power.<p>

<a name="0991"></a><h4>0.9.9.1 Spell ranges</h4>
Directed spells have a range which is a property of the monster spellcaster. This range is the
same for all directed spells, and is generally square; beware of diagonals.
High level monsters gain 1 spell range per 4 levels. Chaotic and lawful spellcasters
have one third less range on Silvernight and Darknight, respectively. Base ranges
are a function of spellcaster type as follows:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Spell ranges</caption>
<tr>
<th>Range <th>Spellcasting monster

<td>3 <td>kobold shaman

<td>15 <td>Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage, quickling bard
</table><p>

<a name="0992"></a><h4>0.9.9.2 Spell powers</h4>
The damage of spells is determined by another parameter of the monster, the spell power.
Every additional level gives a monster +1 spell power;
chaotic and lawful spellcasters get one third more
spell power on Darknight or Silvernight respectively.<p>

<a name="0993"></a><h4>0.9.9.3 Directed spells</h4>
These spells can be cast at range. Monsters will still use them in melee sometimes.<p>

<a name="09931"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.1 Energy bolt / Death ray</h4>
The Death Ray spell, described as an "energy bolt", attempts to instantly kill the target.
It is a dodgable spell and has finite range. Even if it hits, the target still may make a
saving throw and may have resistance; in either case, damage is done instead. There is no
multiple death ray resistance. The damage done by a resisted death ray is equal to
Xd3+Y where X = Max(15, spell power) and Y is 1d(spell power)-1. The PC will save
on a (Mana + Luck) in spell power chance.<p>

<a name="09932"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.2 Stream of energy</h4>
This is a simple non-elemental damage spell. It is displayed as a yellow line
segment and described as a "painful stream of energy", or "strong magical energies"
when affecting monsters. It has finite range and can be dodged when affecting the PC;
against monsters, it can be shrugged like a bolt spell, with attack power equal to
spell power. It does (spell power+2)d4 damage.<p>

<a name="09933"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.3 Confusion</h4>
This spell attempts to confuse its target. There is no path requirement; if the caster
can see the PC and the PC is in range, it is fair game regardless of angle or anything in the middle.
For monsters, success is based on a spell range and level, duration is Max(1, spell power/4)d2;
for PC the maths are much more involved and not worth detailing here in prose. Chance to
resist Confusion depends mainly on Willpower, with an effective +6 Willpower bonus per properly
equipped -Conf item. Luck is also added to effective Willpower. Confusion duration depends mostly
on -Conf items, but there is a small Willpower influence; Wi from 10 to 40 reduces average duration
by 20% (no effect on maximum).<p>

<a name="09934"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.4 Glowing Balls / Magic Missile</h4>
This is attack spell which targets like an arrow. It is dodgable, and can be shrugged by
exactly as a bolt spell. It displays as a blue <tt>*</tt> and is described as glowing
balls, but in the endgame dump is named as magic missiles, leading many to believe it
non-elemental, but it actually does fire damage; it speeds up Drakelings, can melt beeswax,
and is reduced significantly by fire resistance (divided by 1 + 6 if intrinsic, + 3 per item).
Base damage is (spell power/2)d6.<p>

<a name="09935"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.5 Cone of cold</h4>
Works like glowing balls, but deals cold damage. Displays white <tt>*</tt>.<p>

<a name="09936"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.6 Shock bolt</h4>
Works like glowing balls, but deals lightning damage. Displays yellow <tt>*</tt>.<p>

<a name="09937"></a><h4>0.9.9.3.7 Avoiding directed spells</h4>
Your ability to avoid spells is not affected by DV, tactics, what you're avoiding,
or even the level of the caster. There are five checks to evade spells; only one of
them needs to pass. Most of the checks are much harder in the dark. First, you
will avoid a spell on a (Dx + Luck) in (Dx + 50 (120 in dark)) chance. Second,
you will avoid a spell on a (Mana + Luck) in 1000
check. The third check only applies if your speed is greater than 100; you have
a (speed - 100) in 100 (200 in darkness) chance to avoid spells, capped one short
of perfection (99% or 99.5%). Thus, if speed is boosted above 200, or 300 for
darkfighting, effective immunity to bolts is achieved; this is useful to remember
against dangerous spellcasters. Finally come the skill checks. Fourth is a straight
Dodge in 1000 (2000 if darkness) check. Finally, an Alertness check with a difficulty
of 200 (400) is made. Since Alertness is a [+] skill, multiple checks are possible
at high skill values; at 100, Alertness negates 7/8 of bolts that get this far.
With 99 Dexterity, 200 speed, and 100 Alertness, 1 in 2400 spells will connect.<p>

<a name="0994"></a><h4>0.9.9.4 Touch attack spells</h4>
These spells can only be used in melee range, so avoiding them is easy - just stay
out of range.<p>

<a name="09941"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.1 Drain attribute</h4>
Monsters will only use Drain attribute against the PC, never other monsters.
If successful, one random attribute is lowered by 1d3 permanently.<p>

The Drain attribute spell is used by the following spellcasters: black druid,
great white wyrm, greater daemon, lich king, emperor lich, old crone, minotaur mage, 	
multi-headed chaos dragon, Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.<p> 	

<a name="09942"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.2 Curse</h4>
This spell will only be used by monsters against the PC, and has two possible results.
An item is selected from inventory completely at random. If the PC has no items,
or gold is the item chosen, the PC himself will be subjected to the curse; otherwise,
the chosen item will. If the PC already has the Cursed
intrinsic, there is 16.7% chance to gain the Doomed intrinsic instead.<p>

The Curse spell is used by the following spellcasters: black druid,
quickling bard, great black wyrm, black wizard, green hag, annis hag, master lich,
lich king, emperor lich, old crone, minotaur mage, multi-headed chaos dragon,
Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.<p>

<a name="09943"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.3 Teleport other</h4>
Pretty self-explanatory effects, equivalent to zapping a wand of teleportation.
Against monsters, only a level-dependent save is used; low-level monsters will almost never
resist. In principle this provides a way to teleport Khelavaster off the stairs;
sadly, the monster AI will never make attacks against dying sages. No effect on non-teleport levels.<p>

The Teleport other spell is used by the following spellcasters: druid, quickling bard,
fairy dragon, old crone, Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.<p>

<a name="09944"></a><h4>0.9.9.4.4 Avoiding touch attack spells</h4>
The PC avoids attribute drain or "Curse the PC" spells if Luck + 1dMa-1 &gt;= 1d(spell power-1).
Therefore, high Mana and Luck are extremely beneficial, but cannot provide
enough safety from these.<p>

Curse item and Teleport other use easier save. They are avoided if 1d(spell power)-1 &gt; Mana+Luck.
Thus, high Mana can make your PC safe from item curses;
the Mana needed in this way must be equal to the relevant spell power. With 25 or higher Mana,
any item is safe from all cursing monsters that are not also attribute drainers
(if the PC has positive Luck, and it is not Darknight).<p>

<a name="0995"></a><h4>0.9.9.5 Non-targeted spells</h4>
These spells do not require an enemy at all.<p>

<a name="09951"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.1 Invisibility</h4>
Turns the user invisible for (spell power / 2)d4 turns. Used by ogre magus (4d4 turns),
Cat Lord (6d4 turns), and Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage (31d4 turns).<p>

<a name="09952"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.2 Darkness</h4>
Darkens an octagonal area around the caster. Diameter is equal to spell range.
Used by black druid (diameter 5), and Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage (diameter 15).<p>

<a name="09953"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.3 Heal</h4>
Heals the caster up to (spell power)d5 damage, with no effect on any statuses.
Used by priest (4d5), black druid (6d5), druid (13d5), ancient karmic wyrm (22d5),
Ancient Chaos Wyrm (30d5), ancient blue wyrm (30d5), ki-rin (30d5), old crone (40d5),
ancient sage (63d5).<p>

<a name="09954"></a><h4>0.9.9.5.4 Greater Heal</h4>
This spell restores its user to full health and ends bleeding.
Used by ancient sage, emperor lich, lich, lich king, master lich.<p>

<a name="09a"></a><h4>0.9.10 Summoners and Breeders</h4>
<b>Summoners</b> are a type of monster. In addition to their normal attacks and skills, they have the ability to magically call upon 
assistance. Different summoners can summon different types and numbers of monsters. Some summoners are capable of summoning more summoners and 
quickly get out of hand. Summoners will get exhausted by summoning and stop for a while but they will recover and resume summoning. If you or
your companion fights them, they will find less time to continue summoning, but the only way to stop summoners for good is killing them.<p>

List of summoners and what they summon:
<ul>
<li>Balor	-	Random monsters
<li>Black wizard - Random monsters
<li>Blink dog	-	Blink dog
<li>Chaos wizard - Chaos servant, Writhing mass of primal chaos, Greater chaos servant, Chaos warrior
<li>Dark elven priestess -	Large spider, Giant spider, Cave fisher, Tarantula
<li>Dark elven princess	-	Large spider, Giant spider, Cave fisher, Tarantula
<li>Dark elven wizard	-	Large spider, Giant spider, Cave fisher, Tarantula
<li>Emperor lich - Random monsters
<li>Fistanarius the Greater Balor	-	Random monsters
<li>Jackalwere - Jackal
<li>Lich king	-	Random Monsters
<li>Master lich	-	Random Undead
<li>Mimic hivemind - Mimic, Greater mimic, Master mimic
<li>Necromancer -	Zombie, Ghul, Skeleton
<li>Nonnak the Master Necromancer	-	Random undead
<li>Nuurag-Vaarn the Chaos Archmage -	Random monsters
<li>Shadow wyrm	-	Shadow
<li>Shopkeeper - Thug (this summon happens once; Waldenbrook summons Muscular dwarves instead)
<li>Skeletal king	-	Skeletal warrior
<li>Wererat	-	Rat, Giant rat
<li>Werewolf -	Wolf, Dire wolf, Silver wolf
<li>Werewolf lord -	Wolf, Dire wolf, Silver wolf, Werewolf
<li>Werewolf king	-	Wolf, Dire wolf, Silver wolf, Werewolf, Werewolf lord
<li>Yulgash the Master Summoner	-	Random monsters
</ul><p>

<b>Breeders</b> are monsters with the ability to replicate. Unlike summoners, they can only create one type of monster (themselves), and can only create them one at a time.
While all breeders create further monsters of the same species, there are two ways that such monsters can breed: either by spawning separate monsters of the same species, 
or actually duplicating themselves. When a monster duplicates ("The foo duplicates and another foo appears!"), its own HP is halved and the new monster is created with 
the same amount of HP. When a monster spawns another ("The foo spawns another foo!"), the spawner doesn't lose any HP and the spawned monster is created with its HP at full.<p> 

One major difference between breeders and summoners is that breeders can be sterilized - ie. kept from replicating - using a scroll of vermin control, or a prayer.
Note that Gremlins - who replicate only when being splashed with water, for instance from a water trap - are not true summoners nor are they true breeders - true summoners 
and breeders require no outside influence to create more monsters. They are included here for sake of completeness. It should also be noted that duplicated gremlins are considered 
summoned - not bred - creatures by the game.<p>

List of breeders and how they breed:
<ul>
<li>Battle bunny - duplicates
<li>Brown worm - spawns
<li>Chaos rat - duplicates
<li>Chaos spawn - spawns
<li>Claw bug - spawns
<li>Gray ooze - duplicates
<li>Greater claw bug - spawns
<li>Green blob - duplicates
<li>Green slime - duplicates
<li>Green worm - spawns
<li>Gremlin - multiplying itself when it meets water
<li>Killer bug - spawns
<li>Mutated battle bunny - duplicates
<li>Ochre jelly - duplicates
<li>Purple worm - spawns
<li>Red worm - spawns
<li>White worm - spawns
</ul><p>

<a name="09b"></a><h4>0.9.11 Rage</h4>
A monster can be enraged by a number of actions in the game. The exact effects of rage are the same for each monster,
however - due to careless fury, enraged monsters can execute twice as many attacks as normal but lose 3 points of DV.<p>

The following actions are known to make monsters enter a state of rage:
<ul>
<li>Monster stepping on a corpse of another monster of the same race (and same class, where applicable) - "foo steps on the foo corpse and becomes enraged!"
<li>PC eating a corpse within a monster's line of sight that belonged to a monster of that monster's race - "The foo is enraged as he/she/it watches you!"
<li>Sometimes when a monster has taken a certain amount of damage, instead of panicking they decide to fight to the death - "The foo decides to fight to the death in a blind rage!"
<li>Dragons can be angered by <tt>g</tt>iving them a dragon hide item that is the same color as them - "The foo rips the &lt;item&gt; in a fit of anger apart! The foo roars in anger!"
<li>If the PC kills Ruun, all the inhabitants of Dwarftown will become enraged. This makes formidable NPCs such as Waldenbrook especially dangerous.
</ul><p>
