<a name="211"></a><h4>2.1.1 Stone giant lord <tt>H</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 30, Hits: 130, Attacks: 2, Damage: 3d12+8, Speed: 100.</pre>
Sometimes there is a stone giant lord generated outside the High Mountain
Village walls near where the PC enters from the wilderness. Needless to
say, this can be a nasty surprise for a relatively low level PC who has
descended through the Unremarkable Dungeon at the beginning of the game.
If you can't run away, an attack with Berserk tactics may work if the PC
has a decent weapon. He is vulnerable to magic. He doesn't see in darkness nor
through invisibility, which may be used by the player to evade him.<p>

<a name="212"></a><h4>2.1.2 Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 15, Hits: 350, Attacks: 1, Damage: 4d10+10, Speed: 120.</pre>
The burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village will join a PC and act
as a companion providing certain criteria are met: the PC must be at least level 25, must not be
chaotic and the player (<i>not</i> the PC) must know a secret password:
<tt>Iceberg</tt>. The only way to learn the password in ADOM itself is
drinking from pools, and many players are reluctant to do so. Some
players may remember Hawkslayer from the computer RPG "Bard's Tale III".
The password is the same in that game.<p>

Hawkslayer is not super-buff as companions go, but he is not bad.<p>

A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup on September 14th, 2000
described a PC who was very careful with Hawkslayer to start, training
him in the upper levels of the CoC, proceeding to the Big Room then
deeper into the CoC until he was able to take on molochs and balors.
Using a blessed stethoscope on him at that point gave the following:<p>
<pre>
You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis:
Level: 110, DV: 96, PV: 36, Hits: 805, Attacks: 11, Damage: 50-86, Speed: 120.
</pre>
Quite impressive.<p>

Hawkslayer uses eternium arrows which can be retrieved for the PC's own use.<p>

It is possible to equip Hawkslayer with items.
If the PC drops certain equipment to the ground next to him he
will pick up the items and equip them. Unfortunately he will not wear body armor, but will equip boots,
cloaks, gauntlets and shields. Be very careful, however. He will
not equip these items after he is the PC's companion. The items must
simply be dropped next to him <i>before</i> giving him the secret password.<p>

<a name="2l3"></a><h4>2.21.3 Ratling guardians <tt>r</tt> <tt>r</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 18, PV: 7, Hits: 35, Attacks: 1, Damage: 2d6+2, Speed: 101.</pre>
Two ratling guardians are found at the entrance to the city. They seem to
be flavor elements more than anything else and play no real role in the plot
of the game.<p>

Thanks to gut for the following:<p>

They have a peculiarity that makes them useful for one thing. This strategy is really
only worthwhile if the PC has no means of teleportation, and no potions of invisibility,
or Leggot sees invisible too quickly. They are motionless, and will let the PC swap
places with them. This means they can be maneuvered in front of Leggot's shop. Place
a ratling near the doorway, gather the shop items, repeatedly drop them and pick them
up until the shopkeeper doesn't block the doorway (this can take many tries, and being
fast helps), stand in the doorway, and swap places with the ratling. An alarm sounds,
and the PC will be cursed if it's not chaotically aligned. Just kill or outrun the
summoned thugs, which the PC should be able to do at this point in the game. Leggot
won't kill the ratling to get at you, and many thugs will be trapped in his shop as
well, they will just look on angrily as you leave. : )<p>

<a name="214"></a><h4>2.1.4 Leggot, the shopkeeper <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level 11, DV: 19, PV: 10, Hits: 350, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d6+18, Speed: 150.</pre>

Leggot may offer better prices than Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper in Dwarftown, both when selling items
and buying items. He does not share Waldenbrook's hatred of Dark Elves.
Leggot's race varies between games; though he is most commonly either a gnome or dwarf.
There is a smaller chance that he will be a human or troll.<p>

<a name="215"></a><h4>2.1.5 Ogre Guardian <tt>O</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 13, PV: 13, Hits: 90, Attacks: 1, Damage: 4d8+6, Speed: 99.</pre>
Like the ratling guardians, the Ogre Guardian plays no real part in the game.
He guards a prison in the High Mountain Village which holds a few monsters.
The Ogre Guardian does not react if the PC opens the jail and kills the
monsters within. If the Ogre Guardian becomes hostile, he is capable of
throwing huge rocks at the PC.<p>

<a name="216"></a><h4>2.1.6 Gaab'Baay, the old crone <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 45, PV: 28, Hits: 380, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d24+16, Speed: 200.</pre>
Gaab'Baay is an NPC found living in a hidden room in the eastern side of the
High Mountain Village. Her name is an anagram for "Baba Yaga", a mythical Slavic
witch.
Gaab'Baay is of critical importance for those attempting a special ending. She
assigns several quests; the reward is the Medal of Chaos, which is required to
pass through the Chaos Gate. She will assign quests only to PCs with chaotic
alignment - if the PC is lawful or neutral, she will just tell them to 'mature'.
Furthermore, she will not assign quests until the Demented Ratling has been given
six artifacts ("Talk to the mutated one."). Her quests are as follows:

<ol>
<li>Bring her the skull of a giant boar. An annoying quest. Giant boars can only be found
randomly in the wilderness, and rarely leave skulls, even for PCs that have Food
Preservation at 100. This quest can literally take months of game time to complete,
causing elapsed game time to exceed the 90 day point at which time background
corruption starts to accelerate.
<li>Bring a potion of cure corruption. These can
be obtained from Guth'Alak (see section <a href="adomgb-0-10.html#0a311">0.10.3.1.1</a>).
It is worth taking the time to get one from Guth'Alak, since they are very rare otherwise.
<li>Bring the corpse of a farmer. Quite often a farmer will be wandering around the outside of the High
Mountain Village. Otherwise they can be found in Terinyo. It seems farmers leave a
corpse more often after this quest is assigned, but the effect has not been
quantitated. So if you are playing a wild chaotic, use some restraint and don't wipe
out all farmers just because they are easy to kill. It might also be prudent to
kill off the stone giant lord outside the HMV if one is generated. You don't want
him killing off your farmer.
<li>Bring a scroll of danger. Another scarce item.
If the PC finds one, it should be put somewhere safe until it is needed.
<li>Bring a wand of monster creation. Note that a cursed wand of monster creation will work,
but one with zero charges left will not.
</ol><p>

After successfully delivering all of these
items, Gaab'Baay produces the Medal of Chaos. Note that it, like all parts of the
Chaos Trinity, corrupts the PC merely by carrying it. Leave it somewhere safe until
it is needed.<p>

As an opponent, the old crone is very fast, has powerful poison attacks and is capable of
attacking with powerful spells. There is generally never any reason to fight with her, anyway.<p>

<a name="217"></a><h4>2.1.7 Oracle <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 1, Hits: 30, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d8+3, Speed: 120.</pre>
The Oracle is a strange being living in the middle of a pond in the High Mountain Village.
She will reveal cryptic messages about the PC's future when <tt>C</tt>hatted with, and
will explain how to achieve the Ordinary Chaos God ending to PCs with appropriate items.
The most common use for the Oracle is to kill her for her corpse, which is a guaranteed drop,
provides +6 increase to Learning. The corpse
does curse and doom the PC, so it is strongly recommended that the PC have a favourable
disposition with her deity before eating the Oracle.<p>

The Oracle is a karmic being, so missile weapons are recommended to kill her. More importantly,
the Oracle is capable of casting the Death Ray spell, which can instantly kill unprepared
characters. Death rays can only be cast in the straight line, however, and the Oracle is
incapable of walking on the water and leaving her position. As a consequence, she can be
killed quite easily if the PC is not standing in direct line with her.<p>

Curiously, it appears companions will not attack the Oracle when ordered.<p>

<a name="218"></a><h4>2.1.8 Malicious Doctor <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 2, Hits: 27, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d3+1, Speed: 120.</pre>
The Malicious Doctor has a flesh golem <tt>Y</tt> companion for sale for 25,000 gold pieces. He
plays no other part in the game. From the reports of those who have acquired this
companion, it is not worth the money. If the player wants this companion, it is worth
luring the Malicious Doctor to the SMC before buying it. In that case it is generated
with much more experience.<p>

Note that the Malicious Doctor will not sell this companion to lawful PCs. When lawful
PCs <tt>C</tt>hat with him, the game responds with "The malicious doctor eyes you with
suspicion. "My office is closed."<p>

<a name="219"></a><h4>2.1.9 Ratling traders <tt>r</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 10, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
Ratling traders are occasionally generated in the High Mountain Village. Like many
other random monsters in the High Mountain Village, they are quite often hostile.
If the PC needs food at this point, don't kill hostile ratling traders. They may
eventually become nonhostile and therefore a source of food.<p>

<a name="21a"></a><h4>2.1.10 Hidden locations</h4>
There are three hidden locations in the High Mountain Village. Gaab'Baay is located in
a hidden passageway along the eastern wall. Two scrolls are located in the doorless
room in the center of the northern wall. The only way to enter this room is with
teleportation. Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to
and within the room:<p>
<pre>
  #######
  .#.?.#.
  .#^..#.
  .#####.
  ^......
</pre>
The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created. A teleportation
trap can also be created on the square where the scrolls lie, of course.<p>

The two scrolls are a cursed scroll of chaos resistance and a "strange
message". See section <a href="adomgb-5.html#52">5.2</a> for the contents.
The final location is a hidden passage in the western wall. It contains a potion of
ultra healing and a staircase behind yet another hidden door. The staircase leads
to the northern central part of the wilderness.<p>
