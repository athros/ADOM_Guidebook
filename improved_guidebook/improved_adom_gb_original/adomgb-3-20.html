<h3>Blue Dragon Caves</h3>
Blue Dragon Caves is the name commonly given to a five level dungeon found
deep in the Caverns of Chaos. It is entered from a staircase found on the fourth
level of the Unreal Caves (the one that Sharad-Waador is found standing beside);
making it a side-branch of a side-branch of the caverns. It is referred to as
"some ancient dragon caves" in the death log, and uses the shorthand "DL" ingame.<p>

All five levels of the Blue Dragon Caves are cavernous, meaning they have a high
monster generation rate and a lot of open space. Unsurprisingly, there are a
lot of blue dragons found in the caves. Blue baby dragons appear on the first level,
whilst blue dragons and ancient blue dragons appear on deeper levels. In addition
to the many varied blue dragons found in these caves, other nasty
high level monsters may be found here, including chaos wizards, greater titans and
greater molochs, for example. It is wise to have some means of
dealing with greater molochs along, whether it is simply speed for
running away, phase daggers or demon slayers. High speed is
virtually essential for killing Srraxxarrakex, as well.<p>

Upon entering the fifth and final level of the caves, the following
message is generated: "These ancient caves are covered with marks
from huge reptiles... hundreds of such marks." The final level contains only blue dragons
and great blue wyrms. Srraxxarrakex will be found on this level.<p>

When the Blue Dragon Caves were first implemented, there were
complaints that the quest was impossible due to the item destruction.
The amount of item destruction has been toned down a bit, and some players
will actually scum these caves because
killing the blue dragons generates large amounts of valuable equipment,
sometimes including very valuable items such as scrolls of chaos
resistance or rings of djinni summoning.<p>

<pre>Level: 1, DV: 60, PV: 40, Hits: 924, Attacks: 3, Damage: 8d8+12, Speed: 120.</pre>
Sraxxarrakex is a very powerful ancient blue wyrm, more powerful than
any other ancient wyrm in the game. He is, as might be expected,
immune to shock. One of the things that makes him so difficult to
defeat is the fact that he naturally regenerates <i>and</i> casts powerful
healing spells at the same time. He has three attacks per round, so
he can, for instance, breathe a lightning bolt, attack in melee, cast
heal, while still getting natural regeneration <i>per round</i>.
He can also confuse the PC from a distance.
The PC must be capable of dealing massive amounts of damage
quickly in order to defeat him. He can be attacked in almost any way,
including melee, missiles and magic. He is of course vulnerable to
dragon slaying missiles and melee weapons.<p>
