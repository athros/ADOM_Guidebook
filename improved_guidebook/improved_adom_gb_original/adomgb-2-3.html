<h3>Bug-Infested Temple</h3>
<A HREF = "adomgb-2-3-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>
100 PC deaths (or 100 generated PCs) must be recorded in the adom.cnt file
before entry will be allowed (replace contents of the file with four spaces to get entry).
There are no experience or level requirements for entry, either for the PC or
in the HISCORE file.<p>

The Bug-Infested Temple consists of two parts: the bug wilderness
(BUGWIL) and bug cave (BUGCAV). The wilderness part's outer limits are
scattered with greater claw bugs, that low-level spellcasters can bolt
to death (be very cautious!). Around the down staircase, there are eight
killer bugs.<p>

Note that both greater claw bugs and killer bugs have high speed, breed,
have multiple attacks and bypass the PC's PV. This means that they are what
they're called - killers - in melee. Being surrounded by multiple killer bugs
can easily prove to be fatal even to very well armored PCs in the late game.<p>

Eating a greater claw bug corpse increases speed, gives +3 Dx and -6 Wi.
Eating a killer bug corpse also increases speed, gives +6 Dx and -12 Wi.
The increases are no longer guaranteed in ADOM 1.1.1; the upper limit seems
to be around 30.<p>

The <tt>g</tt>s are greater claw bugs and <tt>i</tt>s are killer bugs. <tt>]</tt>s represent
named marble statues. The numeral <tt>1</tt> represents secret doors. Teleportation
doesn't work in BUGCAV, and digging is limited - most of the level is diggable, but there are
undiggable walls blocking most of the useful digging routes.
<a href="bugcav.gif" alt="digging in bugcav">Here</a> is a picture of
the level showing exactly which walls are diggable. The red walls are undiggable, the little yellow
line shows about the only useful digging route, and the light gray walls are secret doors.<p>

The Bug Temple has been beefed up considerably since 1.0.0 with the simple addition of the
see invisible intrinsic for the bugs. Low (or even high) level spellcasters are no longer
going to be able to finish this area easily.The rewards have been toned down: only three SoCRs,
six PoUH, eight SoMM. The wand of fireballs has ten charges, the wand of teleportation has six charges.<p>

All the marble statues can be picked up and broken, like normal ones.
However, there's another meaning to them; reading. They're in place to
honor the prerelease testing group of version 1.0.0. Here's a
compilation of what they all mean and what you get from them, besides rocks.<p>

Note that some of the rewards' stats may vary and that they are all
<i>cursed</i>. However, those potions of ultra healing, scrolls of magic
mapping and especially the scrolls of chaos resistance are a gift that
makes visiting the Bug Cave very worthwhile.<p>

There is one more statue, an "unfinished statue of an unquestionably
famous hero" in honor of Raymond Martineau. No reward for breaking him
down, though.<p>

Breaking the center statue and the statue ten squares west + one north stops
the breeding of the bugs and results in an appropriate line in the accomplishment
list at the end of the game.<p>
