<h3>Rift</h3>
The Rift is a wilderness location found in the northwestern mountains,
southeast of the dungeon containing the Tomb of the High Kings. The
PC must meet several requirements in order to enter it:
<ul>
<li>Climbing skill must be at 100.
<li>The PC must be at least experience level 18. If the experience level
requirement is not met, the game responds with: "You do not feel
experienced enough for this daunting task."
<li>Willpower must be at least 20 OR Perception must be less than 6.
</ul><p>

If all these requirements are met, the PC will still most likely fall
on the way down the Rift, destroying some equipment in the process.
High Luck, the light and nimble corruption, and the very light corruptions
are supposed to make the descent easier: in practice, they may only help
in reducing equipment damage.<p>

There are 27 checks. You have a chance to fall at each check and you always
fall at least once. Chances not to fall:
<ul>
<li>50% Chance (assuming the required 100 Climbing)
<li>25% Chance
<li>Willpower / 100 Chance
<li>Courage / 1000 Chance
</ul><p>

If you fail all these checks, a counter is incremented. That counter is
directly proportional to the health (1d8+2) and inventory damage done.<p>

You can approximate this counter by the messages generated:<p>

<table>
<tr><td>Always  <td>You slip...
<tr><td>&nbsp;  <td>You fall...
<tr><td>x>5     <td>...for a long time...
<tr><td>x>10    <td>...a very long time...
<tr><td>x>18    <td>...almost an eternity...
<tr><td>Always  <td>*BLAMMMM!!!* (or "Blam!" if you have the little weight corruption).
</table><p>

It is not possible to bring artifacts only into the Rift, since a climbing set (and
probably food, although enough <i>might</i> be found) is required. Therefore,
it is a good idea to store the PC's extremely valuable items, such as
scrolls of chaos resistance, in a safe place before entering the Rift.
It is also a good idea to bring every bit of junk, such as missiles that
do not stack, low quality armor and weapons, scrolls of ill fate, cure
blindness and the like, low quality amulets, etc. along. These items are
fodder for the RNG, which hopefully will destroy them rather than valuable
equipment. Do not be too conservative and leave <i>all</i> good equipment
behind, because the monsters in the Rift dungeon and especially the
Sinister Library of Niltrias can be <i>very</i> nasty. Hopefully by this point,
the PC has some decent artifact armor and weapons. A corollary is not to
rush into the Rift too soon.<p>

It is not necessary to visit the Rift dungeon or the Sinister Library
of Niltrias to complete the game, and many who play non-spellcasters
completely ignore it.<p>

The whole point of entering the Rift is to gain access to the Sinister
Library of Niltrias - see next chapter.<p>

After the PC climbs (falls) down the Rift, he arrives in the Rift
dungeon on RL3. The dungeon consists of nine levels, which are
numbered in the opposite sense compared to every other dungeon in the
game (the Tower of Eternal Flames is an exception) - RL1 is the bottom,
while RL9 is the top. There is a guaranteed source of water-breathing
at the bottom of the rift. An amulet/helm of water breathing is generated
somewhere in a corridor. The item is always generated cursed.
This dungeon features dangerous monsters - greater
chaos servants, chaos mutants, elementals, greater elementals and higher
level quicklings are not uncommon. Two up staircases will be found on
RL5 or RL6. One leads to the higher Rift dungeon level, the other leads
into the wilderness in a pass inside the unclimbable mountains. A short
journey, which requires a climbing set, leads to the entrance to
the Sinister Library of Niltrias.<p>

<a name="2f1"></a><h4>2.15.1 Ratling Dealer <tt>r</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 30, PV: 0, Hits: 60, Attacks: 3, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 150.</pre>
If the PC was unlucky enough to have his climbing set destroyed during
the descent through the Rift, another is available from a unique Ratling
Dealer on the bottom level of the Rift dungeon, RL1. This NPC is nonhostile
in an otherwise rather hostile environment. As a consequence, it is
quite possible for him to be killed by other monsters. If the PC needs
a climbing set from him, find him quickly and be prepared to pay 50,000
gold pieces for it.<p>

The Ratling Dealer always asks for 50,000 gp or the whole amount of gold the PC
is carrying, whichever is more. Drop any excess gold if you want to buy the climbing set
from him.<p>
