<a name="0b"></a><h3>Companions</h3>
Did you know that you can order your companions around? Press <tt>Ctrl-o</tt>
to do so. Press <tt>:c</tt> to view a list of your companions.<p>

Companions are allies who will help the PC, to a point. They can
be obtained in several ways:
<ul>
<li>Bards and Farmers get an animal companion from the start
<li>scrolls of familiar summoning
<li>figurines of wondrous power
<li>wishing for <tt>friends</tt>
<li>taming monsters by giving away items or by using the Music skill
<li>in the HMV: Hawkslayer, Borys
<li>slaves are created by using the Necromancy skill on humanoid corpses
</ul><p>

Companions are often
referred to as pets if they are animals. One word of caution before
attempting to create a powerful companion - they are fickle and will
sometimes turn on the PC at the slightest provocation - such as unintentionally 
triggering a fireball trap, injuring the companion. This is a very common 
cause of death from powerful companions. Note that fire-immune companions will 
not turn hostile.  
Some types of companions have a distinct personality and bear careful watching.
A high Charisma score is very helpful when ordering companions about.
Most companions (not undead like an emperor lich) can be healed using
any of the normal techniques - casting Heal and throwing potions of
healing, for example.<p>

One problem that many players have with companions is that
companions have a fixed speed. This means that as the game progresses
and the PC gains speed via wearables, the Athletics skill, eating
quickling corpses, etc., companions become slower and slower relative
to the PC. This can become very annoying, with the PC forced to wait
for companions to catch up. This problem makes many players reluctant
to rely too heavily on companions.<p>

Note also that companions cannot accompany PCs to D:50. Companions
can be <i>created</i> on D:50, but they cannot cross D:49.<p>

<a name="0b1"></a><h4>0.11.1 Scrolls of familiar summoning <tt>?</tt></h4>
These scrolls can be read to create a tame monster. The monster
created is dependent on the danger level of the dungeon level. This
means it is to the PC's advantage to read these in the most dangerous
place possible. In the early midgame, the best place is probably the
Dwarven Halls, since almost anything can show up there. Ancient
karmic dragon, emperor lich and balor companions have been
generated in the Dwarven Halls, for instance. B/U/C status of the scroll 
(+6 DL/0/-6 DL) as well as the Raven birthsign (+5 DL) also contribute to 
the level of the companion.<p>

<a name="0b2"></a><h4>0.11.2 Figurines of wondrous power <tt>]</tt></h4>
These miniature statues are a relatively new feature in ADOM, implemented
by TB in response to players' requests for pet shops. Figurines can also
be found randomly in the dungeons. They generate a monster when <tt>u</tt>sed;
the type of monster corresponds to the name (i.e. a jackal figurine of
wondrous power). If the figurine is blessed when <tt>u</tt>sed, the monster
produced is tame. As with scrolls of familiar summoning, it is best to
use them in a dangerous place. The Small Cave is ideal, since newly
generated monsters have roughly twice the experience level of the PC.<p>

<a name="0b3"></a><h4>0.11.3 Taming monsters</h4>
This is a specialty of Bards, but any PC with the Music skill can try
to tame monsters by placing a musical instrument in the tool slot and
<tt>u</tt>sing it. Most PCs are not very successful at this until the Music
skill level is in the 90s. The success rate is also dependent on the
type of instrument used, with heavier instruments generally better
than light ones. No PC can tame a pet if there are already three pets
on a dungeon level. One or more pets must be led to a different level
and left there. The PC can then return to tame more.<p>

Beggars can be made into companions by giving them gold and/or food.
It requires about 8000 gold pieces and 10 cooked lizards. Berserkers
of the same gender can be tamed by giving them a wedding ring.<p>

Some monsters can be tamed by feeding them. Cave lions and wild cats
can be tamed by giving them rat or giant rat corpses. This is very
useful to remember if the PC wants the Ring of the Master Cat (see
section <a href="adomgb-3-16.html">3.16</a>). Cave tigers can also be tamed, but they refuse to eat rat
or giant rat corpses. Instead, they like pieces of raw or fresh meat.
Unfortunately, it takes more than five pieces of meat to completely tame
them; this is out of reach for most PCs. Wild cats, cave lions, giant raccoons,
and black hurthlings can also be tamed with fish, which can
be obtained from water squares in the wilderness (see section <a href="adomgb-0-4.html">0.4</a> Survival).
Dogs can be tamed by giving them bones, which are readily available by killing
skeletons. This can be especially useful with blink dogs. Tame a blink
dog with bones, then get it involved in a fight. The blink dog will
summon more of his brethren, some of which will inevitably be killed.
A blink dog corpse will eventually be generated, which grants teleport
control when eaten. This is particularly useful for lawful PCs. Since
blink dogs are lawful, killing them will wreak havoc on a lawful PC's
alignment.<p>

Additionally, rust monsters can be made non-hostile by giving them iron items, but they can't be tamed.<p>

<a name="0b4"></a><h4>0.11.4 Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer <tt>@</tt></h4>
Information on the burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village can be found
in section <a href="adomgb-2-1.html#212">2.1.2</a>.<p>

<a name="0b5"></a><h4>0.11.5 Borys, the flesh golem <tt>Y</tt></h4>
A flesh golem can be bought in the High Mountain Village. More
on this in section <a href="adomgb-2-1.html#218">2.1.8</a>.<p>

<a name="0b6"></a><h4>0.11.6 Slaves</h4>
Slaves are the undead created to serve a Necromancer PC. They share
some characteristics with companions. They will fight against a
Necromancer PC's opponents up to the point where injuries cause them
to panic and become afraid of further combat. As with companions, a
high Charisma score enables the Necromancer to better control his
slaves. Note that traditional methods of healing damage undead rather
than healing them. The Bless spell also damages undead. Undead in
skeletal form (skeletons and skeletal warriors) can be healed by
giving them bones. Others must simply heal at their natural rate,
which is often frustratingly slow. Unlike companions, slaves will never
turn on their master.<p>

If a Necromancer manages to survive to a high enough level to find
quickling corpses, especially higher-level quickling corpses, most of
the problems with undead vanish. Quicklings are considered humanoid
in ADOM and so their corpses can be animated with Necromancy. They
are extremely fast (this also means the problem with slow companions
vanishes) and regenerate wounds at a phenomenal
rate. One particular quickling king skeletal warrior on record killed
Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage, before the PC knew it had happened.<p>

Note that slaves are not subject to the experience level 50 limit as
PCs are. It is quite possible for slaves to reach experience level
100 and higher. Needless to say, they become formidable at those
levels.<p>

One trick Necromancers can use to create out of depth slaves is to
exploit the properties of the Small Cave (check section <a href="adomgb-1-4.html">1.4</a>
for a general explanation of how the Small Cave works). In this scenario,
a Necromancer PC avoids entering the Small Cave at the beginning of
the game, instead gaining early experience in the Infinite Dungeon or
elsewhere. As the game progresses, a source of invisibility will
eventually be found. It is rare for monsters that see invisible to
be generated in the Small Cave. At the same time, many are humanoid
and their corpses are usable for Necromancy. If an experience level
20 Necromancer enters the Small Cave while invisible, he can reasonably
expect to leave or descend into the Unremarkable Dungeon with a couple
of level 35 - 40 slaves. Very useful at that point in the game.<p>

Creating undead corpses is chaotic act, which reduces alignment by 300,
costs PP (increases with level) and most importantly Mana.
When Mana is reduced to 1, the PC
can continue creating slaves at no Mana cost, but only those costing 1 Mana.
The PC "is not powerful enough" to create slaves which would reduce Mana attribute
below zero. However, animating a corpse trains Mana 2 000 points.
Note that lvl 1-5 Necromancers, as well as other classed dabbling in Necromancy,
don't get to choose, but create zombie or skeleton randomly. The chance is 100%
zombie at level 1 to about 50% zombie / 50% skeleton at level 5. Mana cost is
reduced for Necromancers at level 40.<p>

Good repeatable sources for more powerful corpses are the Quickling Tree, Minotaur Maze, and
stone giants from Mining.<p>
