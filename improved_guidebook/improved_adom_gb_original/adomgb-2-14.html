<h3>Ruined City</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-14-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>

The Ruined City is the entrance to the Minotaur Maze, found in the
far western central part of the wilderness map.<p>

Upon entering the wilderness square containing the ruined city,
the following messages are generated:
<pre>
As you advance into the ruins, you catch a short sight on some
strange huge figure...

With fluid motions it disappears into the ruins!

Something seems to be waiting for you...

You enter the ancient street of a long-dead and even longer-forgotten
city.

Various trees and shrubs have overgrown the monuments of a former
civilization. Strange unknown runes cover what remains of ancient
palaces and buildings. Some forboding evil seems to lurk beneath
the peace of death emanating from this strange place.
</pre>
A map of the ruined city reveals the strange huge figure to be a
minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance to the Minotaur Maze hidden
behind a secret door:

</pre>
The minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance may or may not be hostile.
This may be alignment dependent (he seems to be always hostile to lawfuls),
among other things and needs further investigation.<p>

There is a lower experience level limit in order to enter the Minotaur
Maze, which is level 22. PCs with lower experience
level are frightened away. Likewise, there is an upper limit, which is
experience level 30. The entrance to the Minotaur Maze is covered by
an immovable stone block at this point. Given the extremely nasty nature of
the Minotaur Maze, the player is well advised to have the PC as experienced
as possible before entering.<p>

The fact that it closes at PC experience level 30 is a potential game-breaker.
If the PC drops a Chaos Orb in the Maze, then achieves experience level 30 outside,
the game is over. Since the Chaos Orb is inside an inaccessible location, it will
never be possible to open the passage to D:49. Note this same scenario can occur
with the Pyramid (section <a href="adomgb-2-9.html">2.9</a>).<p>

The objective is to find the Minotaur Emperor on level seven of
the maze. He holds the artifact Axe of the Minotaur Emperor.<p>

The mazes are very challenging, with false staircases, illusionary walls, living
walls, wall beasts, and a variety of minotaurs, including minotaur mazemasters, mazelords,
magi and kings. The minotaurs have powerful melee attacks and should not be
underestimated. If panicked, all minotaurs will trigger traps and may reveal
illusionary walls as they retreat. Minotaur mages are particularly troublesome,
since they can cast a very potent confusion spell and will drain attributes with
frightful efficiency in melee range. They are highly vulnerable to stun rays.
Living walls are similarly dangerous because of their high PV and ability to
drain Strength.<p>

There is no random food generated in the mazes. The
minotaurs leave corpses, but they are not good to eat because they cause
confusion. Minotaurs may drop food when killed. The mazes are heavily
trapped. It is wise to leave unnecessary equipment behind in order to prevent
its destruction. Since a climbing set is required to reach this portion of the map,
climbing sets should be left behind. The down staircases may lead to false levels,
which must be explored only to find that there are only up staircases with no down
staircase (unless the player keeps reading this GB).
Eventually the PC will find a true level six with a down staircase.<p>

Minotaurs often panic when 'severely wounded' and run away. This can be useful.
Minotaurs only set off the traps in the mazes when in a state of panic. Once
they reach the panicked state, they seem to set off every trap they cross. It
is thus possible to use them strategically to clear a path for the PC.<p>

The player will likely want some way to mark illusionary walls. The easiest
way is to drop a gold piece on either side of the wall. The position of the
wall will then remain marked on the map even if a monster later picks these
coins up.<p>

The easiest and most painless way to complete the maze is to have numerous
blessed scrolls of magic mapping and on-demand teleportation. Simply read
the scroll, and teleport to the stairs. Repeat until the bottom is reached.
Due to the large number of levels in the maze, many scrolls may be required.
With some planning six scrolls is more than enough and you might have eight
from bug temple.<p>

It is very obvious when the true bottom of the maze has been reached, because
the following level message is generated:
<pre>
"You feel that this maze level is special in some respect... its convoluted
tunnels remind you of the brain tunnels of some sinister power lurking
beneath the surface of the world and ready to strike at any intruders!"
</pre>
A representative layout of the final level of the Minotaur Maze is shown here:

<a name="2e11"></a><h4>2.14.1.1 How to find out whether the new level is false?</h4>
All you have to do when you find a down stairs is:
<ol>
<li>find a trap in the new level... not too hard ;)
<li>calculate the level's top trap type, see <a href="adomgb-app-L.html">Appendix L</a>, or the below table
<li>see if it is +5 from the last level
</ol><p>

If it isn't you're on a false level. Turn back.<p>

The mazes actually contain 19-21 levels, as shown on the <a href="maze.gif" alt=maze">following picture</a>.
True levels are 1, 2b, 3d, 4d, 5e, 6c, and 7. Optional levels are 4e and 5a.
The stairs between levels 4d-5d and 5e-6b are also optional.<p>

The top trap types for the maze are shown in the following table - so you don't have to do too much math ;-)<p>

<table border=1><caption>MM Top Trap Types</caption>
<tr><th>Level<th>Top Trap Type<th>Trap #
<tr><td><b>1</b><td><b>Pit with vipers</b><td><b>6</b>

<a name="2e12"></a><h4>2.14.1.2 Minotaur Emperor <tt>M</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 35, Hits: 420, Attacks: 4, Damage: 3d20+30, Speed: 140.</pre>
The Minotaur Emperor is surrounded by four minotaur mages which are able to cast confusion. The mages are vulnerable
to Stun Ray which stops their confusion attacks and leaves them vulnerable.
The Minotaur Emperor is most easily killed with Web and missiles. Melee is
ill-advised. When the Minotaur Emperor is killed, he drops several items
which may vary. One example is:
<pre>
    blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]     [1200s]
    uncursed potion of strength                                        [4s]
    uncursed potion of cure corruption                                 [2s]
    blessed potion of cure corruption                                  [2s]
    uncursed spellbook of Slow Monster                               [100s]
    uncursed minotaur emperor corpse                                 [240s]
    uncursed topaz                                                     [1s]
</pre>

Like all high-ranking minotaurs the emperor's corpse heavily confuses, decreases Willpower by -8
and increases Perception, Strength and Toughness by up to 3 each; but also corrupts (about 1 effect).
A blessed greater ID of the Axe of the Minotaur Emperor reveals:
<pre>
------------ axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4] -----------

Weight: 1200s

When worn it modifies DV by -6 and PV by +4.

When used in melee combat it grants a +12 bonus to hit and causes 3d20+16
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -12 bonus to hit and
causes 3d16+6 points of damage.

It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee.
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.
</pre>

Note the weight of the artifact axe. The weight of the artifact, combined with
the extraordinary difficulty of the mazes, makes most players completely ignore
this location. It is in no way necessary to complete the game.<p>

<small>
In v1.2.0, the axe is 4d20+16 and also grants see invisible. The emperor also
drops a random artifact, several potions of gain attributes and two more spellbooks.
