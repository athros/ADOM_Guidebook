<h3>Lawenilothehl</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-1-3-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</a><p>

Lawenilothehl is an outlaw village found to the southwest of Terinyo.
The name is an anagram of "hole in the wall", American slang for a
shabby place. It contains a variety of shady characters who can be
useful.<p>

<a name="131"></a><h4>1.3.1 Yergius, the master thief <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 32, PV: 7, Hits: 88, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d6+9, Speed: 100.</pre>
Yergius is the head of the Thieves' Guild. He can teach or train a
variety of useful skills for non-lawful PCs. They are Climbing,
Detect Traps, Disarm traps, Pick locks, Pick Pockets and Stealth.
Yergius teaches Pick Pockets to any non-lawful PC at no cost. Bear in
mind that obtaining even the Pick Pockets skill from Yergius is a
chaotic act. He will only teach or train the remainder of these skills
once the PC has demonstrated his talents as a thief. In practice, this
means that the PC must successfully use the Pick Pockets skill 28 times
(according to the recent best estimates) against monsters vulnerable to
this skill. This includes most humanoids, constructs and undead.
Animals in general do not have pockets to pick, although ratlings (not
rats or giant rats, but archers, duelists, fencers, etc.) are vulnerable.
A successful application of the skill will result in a stolen item being
added to the PC's inventory, or the message "The -foo- does not seem to
own anything of value." Note that Yergius' initial training results in
a Pick Pockets skill level of one. This means that it is not really useful
for picking pockets until it is trained and an experience level or two has
been gained, thus making it eligible for advancement. It is useful for
angering nonhostile villagers. Those villagers in line of sight may also
become hostile. Fumbled Pick Pockets attempts are thus a way to generate
hostile villagers without Confusion Blast, Stun Ray or Ventriloquism.
Thrundarr has been moved off his lever with a low Pick Pockets skill. Using
the Pick Pockets skill is a relatively minor chaotic act, and furthermore
seems to have a limited alignment effect. PCs never seem to become C- by
using Pick Pockets.<p>

It is also apparently possible to satisfy Yergius by robbing shops,
but the quantitation is not understood. Furthermore, he will not teach
Pick Pockets to a PC that has already robbed a shop. So if you want a
PC to have access to the Pick Pockets skill, do not rob shops before
obtaining the skill. Robbing shops is a very risky activity for PCs with
less than experience level 20 anyway.<p>

The main initial reason for attempting this quest is to satisfy Yergius
and receive the Detect Traps skill from him. This makes the underground
level of the Dwarven Graveyard and the Pyramid in general much easier
and safer, not to mention the elemental temples.<p>

After satisfying Yergius he will teach new skills for prices ranging from
3500 - 5000 gold pieces. Detect Traps in particular is well worth the
3500 gold pieces it costs. He will also offer training of two different
types: <tt>t</tt>heoretical and <tt>p</tt>ractical. Theoretical training will raise the
PC's dice modifier available when experience level advancement occurs.
The maximum is +4d5. This is simply a matter of cash. If the PC has
plenty of money available and wants to maximize a skill that Yergius
trains quickly, pay him whatever is required to get the modifier to +4d5.
The second form of training he offers is practical. When the PC trains
in this way, it adds successful skill checks to the skill, making it
easier to advance. This also is a matter of cash. It is a very good
idea to use this practical training if the PC is about to face an area
where a newly learned skill will be needed. Again, the underground level
of the Dwarven Graveyard and the Pyramid are obvious examples of areas
where the Detect Traps skill will be needed, while the PC has probably
had little time to train the skill.<p>

Another example where Yergius' theoretical and practical training can be
very useful is the Climbing skill. Climbing = 100 is required for entering
the Rift, which is something all spellcasters should seriously consider
for access to the Sinister Library of Niltrias. Trolls should also visit
the Library for much-needed experience. It is possible to train Climbing
without Yergius' assistance, for example by mountaineering, but this takes
place in the wilderness, thus wasting large amounts of valuable time.<p>

The following table summarizes the costs for Yergius training:<p>

Yergius will never move from his position (unless hostile), but can be swapped
with using the <tt>:s</tt> command. This can be exploited to block doorways or
other passages - notably, he can be used to block the exit to the Black Market,
which can allow the PC to rob the store (not without risk, however).<p>

PCs who kill Yergius become the new head of the Thieves' Guild
and as such receive 50% off the prices at Barnabas' black market (see next
section). Of course killing him means that he is no longer available
for training, so take advantage of his training before killing him.<p>

Yergius also sells thieves picks to non-lawful PCs with the Pick Locks
skill who have no thieves picks.<p>

<a name="132"></a><h4>1.3.2 Barnabas, the shopkeeper <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 13, DV: 18, PV: 10, Hits: 410, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d6+18, Speed: 140.</pre>
Barnabas maintains a general store type of shop in Lawenilothehl. As
might be expected from the general atmosphere in the town, it is a black
market. As such, the prices demanded are very high. Nevertheless, it
is worth visiting. Simply observing what is for sale identifies items.
Barnabas also usually has rocks for sale at relatively reasonable prices,
which can be tremendously useful for Hurthlings. Barnabas occasionally
has high quality items for sale, which can be within the monetary reach
of PCs who have done the Kranach quest. In addition to the 50% reduction
in prices for being head of the Thieves' Guild (see above section 1.3.1),
Barnabas also changes his offers when the PC sells items: 1/4 of base value
for nonmembers, 1/3 of base value for members and 1/2 of base value if the
PC is the head of the Thieves' Guild, regardless of whether she was a former
member.<p>

<a name="133"></a><h4>1.3.3 Kranf Niest, the mad doctor <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 3, Hits: 58, Attacks: 5, Damage: 1d3+8, Speed: 100.</pre>
Kranf Niest appears to be always busy planning experiments, and serves
little purpose in the game. Hovewer, he can teach PCs the Healing skill
after completing Hotzenplotz's Kill Jharod quest.
He does not have the gentle touch of Jharod (however he will teach Healing at
60 value, whereas Jharod provides only 10-20 value). When a chaotic PC
learns the Healing skill from him, the PC is teleported away in a
stunned and confused state, loses 1d3 points in each of the Appearance,
Learning and Willpower categories and is corrupted slightly (1%).
During this process, Kranf Niest removes any helmet the PC might be
wearing, even if it is cursed. If the PC already has Healing, Kranf
Niest gives the PC a scalpel and a stethoscope. It is a chaotic act to
attack Kranf Niest, but the PC receives a small net lawful boost for
killing him.<p>

<a name="134"></a><h4>1.3.4 Skriek, the cloaked ratling <tt>r</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 2, Hits: 32, Attacks: 3, Damage: 1d6+5, Speed: 100.</pre>
Skriek sells random keys. The prices for males seem exorbitant (470 + 30*level gold),
but they can save a PC's life. Female PCs receive a 50% discount.
Note that Skriek becomes hostile if the PC attacks Hotzenplotz, one of Tywat
Pare's quests. He is quite evasive, but overall not a very dangerous opponent.
He can be lured away from the bandit village, for example to
Terinyo, where he will sell keys even after Hotzenplotz is killed.<p>

<a name="135"></a><h4>1.3.5 Hotzenplotz, the crime lord <tt>@</tt> and his half-orc bouncer guards <tt>@</tt><tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Crime lord: Level: 1, DV: 19, PV: 9, Hits: 80, Attacks: 4, Damage: 2d8+4, Speed: 100.
Half-orc bouncer: Level: 1, DV: 12, PV: 12, Hits: 64, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d8+8, Speed: 100.</pre>

Hotzenplotz assigns two quests. The first is to kill Jharod, the healer.
Jharod, and thus this quest, is only available if the PC has chosen Rynt's Yrrigs quest rather
than Guth'Alak's Keethrax quest. Hotzenplotz arranges for Kranf Niest to
teach the Healing skill as a reward. The second is to kill Tywat Pare.
The reward is an amulet of chaos. If the PC is on a mission from Tywat
Pare to kill Hotzenplotz, a couple of points are worth remembering.
Attacking Hotzenplotz will cause most of the inhabitants of Lawenilothehl
to become hostile, with the exceptions of Barnabas,Yergius and Kranf Niest.
Hotzenplotz is fairly tough, bypasses PV and uses poison. He will kill a PC without
poison resistance in melee quite easily. However, he does not heal. A
PC can attack him, run away into the wilderness and repeat this process
until he is dead. The combination of these two characteristics should
make it clear that the best way to attack him is with missiles or ranged
spells.<p>

It is possible for a relatively low level PC (especially Hurthlings) to kill
him with thrown rocks, but special tactics are necessary. Lure him out of his
hut and flee towards the right side of town while pelting him with rocks.
Leave town and reenter from the left. Continue to throw rocks until he succumbs.<p>

Hotzenplotz's guards, Grunge and Munge, will become hostile if either they are attacked,
or Hotzenplotz is attacked; meaning that PCs undertaking the Kill Hotzenplotz quest
will have to fight them as well (or just run away). Unlike Hotzenplotz, the guards
are orcs so they see in darkness.<p>

Hotzenplotz and his guards can be exploited. They will often attack hostile monsters
that are led into their hut. If one of the nastier monsters found in Lawenilothehl
(assassin, outlaw leader) attacks a weak PC, run for Hotzenplotz's hut.<p>

When killed, Hotzenplotz typically drops from 1500 to 6000 gold pieces.<p>

<a name="136"></a><h4>1.3.6 Other inhabitants of Lawenilothehl <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Beggar: Level: 1, DV: 7, PV: 0, Hits: 2, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d3, Speed: 100.
Assasin: Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 4, Hits: 16, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d10+2, Speed: 100.
Mugger: Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 3, Hits: 20, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d10+4, Speed: 100.
Cutpurse: Level: 1, DV: 17, PV: 0, Hits: 6, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4+3, Speed: 100.
Bandit: Level: 1, DV: 13, PV: 2, Hits: 14, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d8+1, Speed: 100.
Outlaw: Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 4, Hits: 18, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+2, Speed: 100.
Outlaw leader: Level: 1, DV: 17, PV: 5, Hits: 40, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+4, Speed: 100.</pre>

The other inhabitants are simply flavor elements with no real role in
the game. They include beggars, assassins, muggers, cutpurses, bandits,
outlaws and outlaw leaders. Beggars are useful because they can drop a potion
of booze if the PC <tt>g</tt>ives them 40 or more gold pieces and then <tt>C</tt>hats with them.
There is a 50% chance they'll give you a fortune cookie message instead; if so, try again
until they give you booze. Each beggar can only give 1 potion of booze.
It is always cursed. Remember Yggaz, the fool in Terinyo, will trade
random potions for potions of booze. Giving food to beggars raises
alignment by nutrition value / 10, but min 10 and max 100.<p>

Corpses of the other Lawenilothehl inhabitants yield reward from Tywat Pare in Terinyo.<p>
