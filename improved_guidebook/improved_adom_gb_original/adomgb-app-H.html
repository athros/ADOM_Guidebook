[1] The gold piece damage is significantly better for Merchants.<br>
The amount of gold creation is DLd30-1 + DLd10-1 + DL*5, Miser has a 1/5 chance to increase it by (1d20+100) * PreviousTotal/100.<p>
[2] Blessed may give +2d2 MaxPP, cursed -2d2 MaxPP. Actual chance is based on Luck, maximum 25%.<p>
[3] Le&lt;20:+1d2Le; else (100-((Le-19)^2))%:+1d2Le; 1%:+1d2Le; see also <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#0616">0.6.1.6</a>.<p>

Gems are meant as means to carry wealth effectively - however it is not too effective in ADOM.
Gems and crystals are made from crystal, worthless pieces are from glass. Gems can be used with slings. The base damage value is
(+0, 1d1) rather than the (+0, 1d4) of a rock, but gems are lighter, and crystals of fire will create fireballs at their point of impact.<p>
