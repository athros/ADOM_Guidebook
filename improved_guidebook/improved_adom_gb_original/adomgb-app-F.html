and corrupts 20 CPs per turn spent reading, min 200, max 6666. As an artifact, the black tome cannot be destroyed - if a failure
would destroy it, the next entry in the list is used instead (see <a href="adomgb-0-5.html#0515">0.5.1.5</a> Learning spells mechanics).<p>

[1] Scrolls of defense and protection affect only the following worn items in this order: armor,
helmet, cloak, boots, gauntlets, girdle, bracers. Cursed SoD and SoP always decrease DV or PV by
one. Blessed SoD and SoP may increase items with low DV or PV by two or three points.<p>
[2] Raven borns get additional DL+5 and a more powerful ally on top of that.<p>
[3] As you know (see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0eb">0.14.11</a>) you can only dip 1 item into a potion of holy water
at a time if the item in question is 10s or heavier. So a stack of say,
20 waterproof blankets will need 20 potions to bless them all. This would
be quite a waste of holy water. This can be walked around by using
scrolls of repair. Cursed scroll will break the stack and a blessed one will repair it
AND improve B/U/C status by one rank. So a (cursed) stack of items,
regardless of size can first be broken with a cursed scroll of repair,
then repaired and blessed with a blessed scroll of repair. This is
very cheap considering scrolls of repair can be manipulated easily in
large stack using a combination of cursed scroll of uncursing (or unholy water) and holy
water (thanks Anh Tong for this tip).<p>
[4] Does not disappear after reading.<p>

All scrolls weigh 2s. All books and scrolls are made of paper. When used in melee or as a missile, scrolls do (+0, 1d1) damage.<p>
