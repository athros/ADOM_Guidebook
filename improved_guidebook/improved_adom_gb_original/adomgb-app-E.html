</table><p>

[1] Add 3 to the average if potion if blessed, substract 3 if cursed.<p>
[2] Blessed potion drunks for about 60 turns, uncursed 35, cursed
10 turns. While drunk, the PC gets about -3 DV, -5 speed, -1 to hit, and
+2 to melee damage. Cursed potion also blinds for short time.<p>
[3] Throw holy water to damage undead for 6d6, this also raises alignment.<p>
[4] Throw at rust monsters to permanently remove their rusting capability.<p>
[5] Cursed grants 1 casting if no previous knowledge.<p>
[6] So it is possible to have for example "rusty rustproof orcish spear".<p>  

Most potions increase hunger level by 100 when drunk, exceptions are:
<ul>
<li>potion of poison: no satiation
<li>potion of booze, potion of carrot juice, potion of gain attributes, 
potion of invisibility, potion of visibility, potion of water: 20 satiation
<li>potion of exchange: 500 satiation
<li>potion of balance: 1000 satiation
<li>potion of toughness, potion of potential toughness: 2000 satiation,
can be drunk even when Bloated
</ul><p>

Blessed potions give +25% more satiation, cursed -50%, +10% if Wolf birthsign, 
-95% savegame cheating.<p>
  
All potions are made of glass. When used in melee or as a missile, potions do 
(+0, 1d2) damage in addition to their normal effect. They are destroyed after 
such attack.<p>
