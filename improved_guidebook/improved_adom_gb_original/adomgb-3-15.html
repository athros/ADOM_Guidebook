<h3>Battle bunnies</h3>
<pre>Battle bunny: Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 7, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d2, Speed: 100.
Mutated battle bunny: Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 14, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d4, Speed: 150.</pre>

This level is found on D: 33 or D: 34. You will know when you find it, because
the level message "You suddenly sense an intense tension." is generated. It
consists of a long northern corridor connected to a long southern corridor. 
Traversing these corridors allows time for the inhabitants of the level, battle
bunnies <tt>r</tt>, to breed. This is to be avoided as they breed like, well, rabbits. It
can quickly get out of control. The best way to deal with the level is to
immediately tunnel (or teleport) south by any means at the PC's disposal and
kill Bugs, the leader of the level. This drastically reduces or eliminates
further breeding of the bunnies. Kill the remainder and descend. Note that
scrolls of vermin control do not work on the level, instead exploding to produce
a green cloud of foul smoke.<p>

Following are observations from David Chao:<p>

A PC who has many castings of Cure Light Wounds (or some other healing spell and the power points to
support it reasonably, Cure Light Wounds is the least costly) can exploit the Battle Bunny level for
an extremely quick and easy way to achieve L+ alignment.<p>

I'm not completely sure of the mechanics of their breeding, but I assume from observation that the Battle
Bunnies do something in the context of reducing their hitpoints by half when they breed (needs testing
from a PC that has a blessed stethescope). For every Battle Bunny that reproduces, you get two Battle
Bunnies that are injured, and thus are viable for healing for lawful alignment boost. Once the PC is
done healing a Battle Bunny, he can kill off each one he heals and then be surrounded by more injured
Battle Bunnies which he can heal for even more alignment boosts.<p>

Try to make sure Bugs is next to you while doing this, so that he may be killed once the PC has no more use
for rapidly breeding Battle Bunnies. This is especially an option to consider for high level Wizards, who
will be guaranteed access to every spell in the game at the Library, including healing spells and anything
else the PC might need to make his job easier.<p>

Using Calm Monster on the Battle Bunnies if you're trying to stay lawful is a silly idea because you cannot
<tt>:s</tt>wap positions with them even if they are non-hostile.<p>

<a name="3f1"></a><h4>3.15.1 Bugs, the bunny master <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 0, Hits: 220, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+18, Speed: 100.</pre>

It is believed that the rate at which battle bunnies breed on the level is increased whilst Bugs is alive;
so PCs are advised to kill him as soon as possible. He can disarm PCs in melee range, but is not very tough
or dangerous for the stage in the game he is found (particularly since the PC has to defeat the Ancient
Chaos Wyrm to get this far).<p>
