<h3>Infinite Dungeon - beginning</h3>
More about the Infinite Dungeon (ID) can be found in section <a href="adomgb-2-2.html">2.2</a>.
Here we are concerned only with the start of the game.<p>

<a name="151"></a><h4>1.5.1 Why start the game in the Infinite Dungeon?</h4>
Starting the game in the ID is a very conservative approach for PCs that are weak at
the start of the game. Given the significance of the first kill, it is probably not
advisable to make the first kill in the ID, but gaining further experience while
staying on level one of the ID is about as safe as things get in ADOM. The PC can
flee from anything threatening, such as dark rooms or tension rooms, by exiting the
ID and reentering. This strategy is one way to get difficult classes to experience
level five or so before the ID becomes intolerably tedious.<p>
