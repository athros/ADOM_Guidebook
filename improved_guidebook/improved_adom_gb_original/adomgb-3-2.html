<h3>Arena</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-3-2-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>

The Arena level is found on D: 3-5. It can be immediately recognized by repeated
messages saying "You hear the ecstatic cries of a large crowd!"
As might be expected at a huge attraction like the Arena, there are vendors selling
items on this level.<p>

The Arena itself is for combat practice, with the rewards for a successful fight being
gold pieces. The rewards get larger as the PC wins more fights. A PC should not fight
more than nineteen times in the Arena before descending to deeper levels of the CoC.
This is because she will encounter an NPC later (see <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#3531">3.5.3.1</a>)
who assigns a quest to win the 20th Arena fight.<p>

<a name="321"></a><h4>3.2.1 20th Arena opponent</h4>
The 20th fight will be against a named former champion. These opponents are
more difficult than the standard Arena opponents. There are four possibilities:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Possible 20th arena opponent</caption>
<tr><th>Opponent   <th>Race       <th>Remarks
<tr><td>Li-Hon-Kay <td>ogre magus <td>uses Invisibility and Frost Bolt, regenerates; alternate name Li-Han-Kay
<tr><td>Spardakius <td>minotaur   <td>brute force
<tr><td>Ripclaw    <td>troll      <td>brute force
<tr><td>Bonk       <td>hill giant <td>brute force
</table><p>

Li-Hon-Kay can be particularly annoying and dangerous. PCs without cold resistance
and the ability to see invisible will probably not survive a fight with Li-Hon-Kay.
Fortunately, cold immunity and the ability to see invisible are granted by the Ancient
Mummy Wrapping, an artifact armor held by Rehetep, the Mummy Lord (see section <a href="adomgb-2-9.html#2921">2.9.2.1</a>).
Players who want to be conservative and maximize the chances of survival in the 20th
Arena fight will tackle the Pyramid first. Note also that although ogre magi are
somewhat resistant to confusion, if one is successfully confused using Mindcraft,
they are unable to become invisible. This works for Li-Hon-Kay as well as ordinary
ogre magi. The other 20th fight Arena opponents will fall to offensive magic or simple
brute force bashing.<p>

The reward for winning the 20th Arena fight is an artifact sword, the Golden Gladius.
<pre>
------- golden gladius "Death's Sting" (+2, 2d5+2) [+3, +3] (+7 spd) -------

Weight: 30s

When worn it modifies DV by +3 and PV by +3.

When used in melee combat it grants a +2 bonus to hit and causes 2d5+2
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and
causes 1d3 points of damage.

It modifies your speed by +7.
</pre>
There are a limited number of fights available after the 20th fight, but beware:
anything can be generated as an opponent in such fights. It is quite possible to be
faced with an emperor lich or ancient karmic dragon. The monetary rewards for such
fights are about 1000 gold pieces each, not worth it if the PC has to face a difficult
opponent. Furthermore, the experience gains from these fights are dependent on the
experience level of the PC. Those who have difficulty gaining experience (Trolls,
Raven-born Athletic Monks, etc.) should leave these fights for when they are at a
high experience level.<p>

<a name="322"></a><h4>3.2.2 Remaining arena opponents</h4>
Timofei Shatrov has determined the possible opponents the PC
will face in the Arena. There are five possible opponents in each fight, although some
of them are duplicates. The table below shows the possible opponents, with cats in
bold capitals and duplicates in parentheses:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Possible arena opponents</caption>
<tr><th>Round<th colspan=5>Possible opponents

</table><p>

<a name="323"></a><h4>3.2.3 Dak, the arena master <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 22, PV: 12, Hits: 108, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+12, Speed: 100.</pre>
The Arena Master provides access to the Arena. Note that he will
not admit invisible PCs to the Arena, whether or not they have fought in the Arena
before. He responds with "Sorry, we've hired more than enough invisible stalkers. Look
for a job elsewhere or come back when some of yer pals are used up."
Player with permanent invisibility obtained from a pool or invisible stalker corpse can only enter the Arena under the influence
of a potion of visibility. For this reason it may be wise to at least finish 19 arena fights, if not become a champion altogether,
before the PC drinks from any pools. If the PC teleports out of the Arena without killing the opponent and returns to Dak, he tries to
stun, then confuse, then paralyze the PC before teleporting him/her back into the Arena.<p>

Note that it is possible to unintentionally cause Dak to become hostile during an arena fight,
eg. if he is hit by a ball spell that reaches outside the front entrance of the Arena.
Doing so will end the fight after a certain amount of turns, and cause the Arena Master to
attack without giving a reward for the completed fight (and, of course, forfeit the possibility
of any future fights and rewards).<p>

Also, if you create a closed door on the tile the PC is teleported to after winning a fight, it will be
opened and the message "You hear a short clapping sound" is displayed upon winning again. This is the
only way to teleport on top of a door in ADOM, and according the old bug tracker, said effect was
intentionally coded for this sole possibility.<p>

<a name="324"></a><h4>3.2.4 Ratling traders <tt>r</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 10, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
There are several ratling traders on the Arena level who sell food. The best food
source is cooked lizards, which weigh only 3 stones each and are very nutritious. Also
available are fried bats, which are less nutritious, but still acceptable. It is not
worth buying rat tails, fat worms, and cooked roaches. They have very low nutrition value, even
for Trolls, who can eat almost anything. See <a href="adomgb-app-G.html">Appendix G</a>
for details.<p>

In contrast to shops, which restock dependent on total game time passed, the ratling
traders seem to restock dependent on game passed on the Arena level only. Thus a PC
may go off adventuring for many days, return to the Arena and find no new food
available. Wait or run around on the level for a while and the traders should
eventually restock.<p>

It is worthwhile to <tt>n</tt>ame the ratling traders according to the wares they sell.
This prevents aimless searching for the traders who sell worthwhile food. They can also be
slowed down with the Slow Monster spell, which will not turn them hostile.<p>

<a name="325"></a><h4>3.2.5 Ratling rebel <tt>r</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 19, PV: 4, Hits: 18, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>

The ratling rebel plays no important role. He provides scrolls denouncing arena fights. They can be sold
for small amount of cash, used for training Literacy, cleared with a potion of water for use with
a magical writing set, or polymorphed with blessed potion of exchange or potion of raw chaos to turn them
into a more useful scroll. Note there is no danger of explosion.
The ratling rebel will attack PCs wearing furs when chatted with. Another way to make him hostile is to
<tt>g</tt>ive him back his pamphlet. He rewards PCs that kill Dak the Arena Master with a scroll of peace, and
alignment shift towards N=. After obtaining the scroll of peace from him, he will not give pamphlets anymore.<p>

<a name="326"></a><h4>3.2.6 Cats in the Arena <tt>f</tt></h4>
Cats in the Arena are a special problem. If the PC wants the Ring of the Master Cat,
directly killing cats must be avoided (see section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#092">0.9.2</a>).
There are several ways to deal with cats in the Arena. Teleportation is one, from a wand or spell. Potions of
exchange thrown at a cat will turn it into another monster. A cat can be led over a
trap until it is killed, teleported or turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos.
However, if the PC sets off a trap which kills a cat, he is charged with
killing the cat. For this reason, as well as general
tactical information, it is useful to know the layout of traps in the Arena when they
are created. A map showing the traps produced when the Arena is generated on D: 3 is
shown below:
<pre>
  ###############.###############
  #0123456789AB0###456789AB01234#
  #123456789AB0123456789AB012345#
  #23456789AB0123456789AB0123456#
  #3456789AB0123456789AB01234567#
  ###############################

    0 - fireball      6 - arrow
    1 - pit           7 - acid
    2 - light         8 - pit (vipers)
    3 - corruption    9 - spear
    4 - stone block   A - teleport
    5 - alarm         B - water
</pre>
The pattern shifts, but otherwise remains the same, and can therefore be worked out by
creating a single trap, when the Arena is generated on other levels.<p>
