<h3>Infinite Dungeon</h3>
The Infinite Dungeon is found in the southeastern part of the wilderness map.
Prior to entering it, the description is "A tiny, strangely distorted cave
entry."<p>

The Infinite Dungeon (ID) is truly infinite for all practical purposes. The
level number is limited by a signed 32 bit integer value, but who really
cares about that? It would take many lifetimes to descend through all its
levels, even assuming a PC could survive such a trip, which is impossible.
The danger level increases with dungeon level; any level greater than 200 or
so becomes ridiculous.<p>

The ID has some unique characteristics: shops, altars and pools are never
generated. Every dungeon level is randomly generated, so leaving a level and
reentering it results in a completely new dungeon level. There is one special
level, the SIL, where MaLaKaI resides.<p>

According to the Mad Minstrel, the ID was originally a monument built by the
powers of law. The incursion of Chaos into Ancardia has twisted it into its
current condition.<p>

Any non-hostile mobs, including Filk, that you <i>lose</i> in the ID will
re-appear later in the wilderness to meet up with you.<p>

<b>Stair-hopping</b> (thanks to gut for this section)<p>
Stair hopping is the process of repeatedly ascending and descending a single
staircase in the ID, for the purpose of generating hoards of items in the
continuously generated rooms. Items generated on the ID's floors will be of a
danger level equal to 1/3 of the ID's dungeon level. That means only DL1 items
will be generated on ID levels 1-5. On ID levels 6-8, DL2 items can be generated,
and DL3 items can be generated on ID levels 9-11. This applies to dipping items
into potions of raw chaos and exchange as well. This does not apply to guaranteed
drops, like eternium gear from chaos warriors. Also, it seems that this does
not always apply to monster generation either.<p>

Benefits of stair hopping include: An easy way to acquire spellbooks, as they are
all DL1, and thus available even on ID levels 1-2. An easy way to acquire extra DV/PV
points for the early game, as shields, hats, gauntlets, boots, etc... can sometimes
have nice stats. An easy source of teleport control (actually the only guaranteed
source of TP control in the game), as blink dogs can be found after ID 4 (sometimes
earlier). An easy way to acquire potions and scrolls that can save a PC's life.<p>

<a name="221"></a><h4>2.2.1 Filk, the quickling bard <tt>p</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 500, PV: 3, Hits: 58, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4+9, Speed: 1500.</pre>
Once the PC takes the quest to kill Filk from the Assassin Prince
(more about this is found in section <a href="adomgb-4.html#4311">4.3.1.1</a>),
Filk appears in the Infinite Dungeon on the level corresponding to
the number of first-killed monsters killed.
For example if the first monster killed was a rat and 225 rats have been killed,
Filk will be found on I: 225. If the PC reaches the level Filk is on but leaves
the ID without slaying him, he can found randomly in the wilderness; in which
case the player will be asked if they wish for Filk to accompany the PC.<p>

Filk shares the properties of karmics although he is not named as such.
He is easiest killed with ball spells.<p>

When chatted to, Filk asks the PC to kill his arch enemy the Mad Minstrel.
If the PC does so, though, Filk will not give any reward; he will just say
"Meisaveryhappyquickling!" when chatted with. Since killing Filk for the Mad
Minstrel opens the possibility of an Ultra ending, it would be very wise for
the player to take the Mad Minstrel's side in this dispute.<p>

If the PC tries to wish for "quickling bard", lots of hostile quickling lords
will be summoned instead.<p>

<a name="222"></a><h4>2.2.2 MaLaKaI, the dwarven chaos knight <tt>h</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 79, DV: 70, PV: 30, Hits: 450, Attacks: 8, Damage: 4d6+32, Speed: 110.</pre>
MaLaKaI resides in the SIL, found at level 66 of the ID. He guards the Sceptre of Chaos,
a part of the Chaos Trinity.<p>
<pre>
----------- Sceptre of Chaos (+8, 6d6+8) [-8, +0] {Ma+8} (+8 spd) ----------

Weight: 800s

When worn it modifies DV by -8 and PV by +0.

When used in melee combat it grants a +8 bonus to hit and causes 6d6+8
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and
causes 1d40+20 points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +8.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It modifies your speed by +8.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants bad luck.
Wearing it makes you doomed.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.
</pre>

The SIL is not really part of the ID. It is discovered by descending through the ID normally, but once left,
it can never be found again. This means if a PC needs the Sceptre of Chaos,
there is only one chance to get it, so be prepared. MaLaKaI is quite tough.
He has a corrupting melee attack and attacks 8 times per round. He cannot see in darkness
and is vulnerable to humanoid and demon slaying weapons and ammo.<p>

Conclusive proof that the SIL is not part of the ID is the fact that altars
are sometimes generated in the SIL. These can come in very handy since
MaLaKaI can be sacrificed.<p>
