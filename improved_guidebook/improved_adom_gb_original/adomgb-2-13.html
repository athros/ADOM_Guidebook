<h3>Water Dragon's Lair</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-13-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>

The Water Dragon's Lair is located in a random water-containing
square of the wilderness. It contains Shyssiryxius, the water
dragon (Blup's mother), her treasure hoard and various other
aquatic beasts. It consists of a labyrinth and a central room
containing Shyssiryxius and the treasure. The entire cave is
submerged, so ordinarily some means of water breathing and the
Swimming skill are required. The most common method of obtaining
water breathing is through a helm of water breathing (generally a
"blue helmet" before identification). Wearing two rings of the
fish (or one blessed) also grants this, although they are autocursing. If the PC
is not born with the Swimming skill, it can be obtained from Blup
by giving him potions of carrot juice. The need for these
abilities ordinarily keeps low level PCs out of the lair, which is
as it should be. The aquatic beasts found in the labyrinth are
not trivial, especially the dragon turtles. Sharks and giant eels
can also be found. None of these monsters see invisible.<p>

In theory a PC with on demand teleportation, high hit points and
possibly some regeneration could survive a teleport to
Shyssiryxius (36 squares to the left), a chat and a teleport to the up
stairs without water breathing or Swimming.<p>

There are two main reasons for entering. The first is to <tt>C</tt>hat
with Shyssiryxius then return to Terinyo. This allows the PC to
inform Blup about the location of his mother, which results in
eventual delivery of the rune-covered trident, a decent artifact
weapon and missile, later in the game. The trident will arrive by a water
elemental messenger not long after reaching character level 16 for PCs born
in the Raven starsign. Others have to wait until level 36.
<pre>
------------ rune-covered trident (+6, 3d12+6) [+4, +4] {Dx+12} ------------

Weight: 80s

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +4.

When used in melee combat it grants a +6 bonus to hit and causes 3d12+6
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +2 bonus to hit and
causes 3d8+4 points of damage.

It is an undead slayer.
It is a demon slayer.
It modifies your dexterity attribute by +12.
This weapon returns when thrown.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
It grants immunity to cold attacks.
It grants the ability to breathe water.
</pre>
If Shyssiryxius is killed before Blup has been informed of her whereabouts,
the PC will not receive the Rune covered trident; however, once Blup has been
informed, she can be killed even if the trident has not yet arrived without
forfeiting it - she already sent it, after all. The location
of the lair is not decided until the PC starts searching for it,
so it is more or less possible to place it in a convenient location,
such as near Terinyo.<p>

The second reason for entering the lair is to loot it. There are
occasionally outstanding items found in the treasure hoard. As
might be expected, Shyssiryxius does not take kindly to thieves
and will attack. She does not see in darkness, however. Cast
Darkness over desired item(s), pick them up and leave.<p>

Monsters tamed in the underwater cave can leave with the PC and
breathe air. This is probably a game bug.<p>

<a name="2d1"></a><h4>2.13.1 Shyssiryxius, the great water dragon <tt>D</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 70, PV: 40, Hits: 1140, Attacks: 3, Damage: 6d15+12, Speed: 120.</pre>
Under normal circumstances, Shyssiryxius is not hostile, only
intimidating. If she is <tt>C</tt>hatted with, she roars "HAST YE SEEN
MY BABY?" (or "*DIE*" if the PC has done something to make her
hostile). Whether she is hostile or not, the PC can leave after
chatting and report back to Blup. This of course assumes a PC
facing her when she is hostile survives (see below). If the PC
attempts to steal from her treasure hoard, she gives a warning
about not picking anything up. If the PC persists, she will attack.
She is a formidable opponent with a reasonably powerful melee attack
and a deadly water breath attack that is capable of dealing circa
100 points of damage in a single round. Sources of water breathing
will reduce the damage of this attack.
She regenerates and is immune to cold. She is capable of teleporting and does so when
she panics, making the PC work to find her while remaining
underwater the whole time. She can be killed, but it takes an
upper level PC, and it doesn't hurt to have some blessed potions
of extra healing along. Note that Shyssiryxius, like certain other
powerful monsters, is unable to fight in Darkness unless panicked. She is
also vulnerable to poison.<p>
