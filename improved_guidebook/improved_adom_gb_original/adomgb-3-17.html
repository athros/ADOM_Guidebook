<h3>Air Temple</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-3-17-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>

The Air Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 38-42, below the Casino.  
The layout, on the left side of the level, is as follows:
<pre>
       ##################                  ###########   #####################

The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is 
disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on 
the level. Note the traps. The numeral <tt>1</tt> is used to indicate secret doors.
Note the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until he is 
disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. The air
demons (or Yulgash himself) will sacrifice the PC instantly should he step on 
it. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or
Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in 
the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Air
Temple are arrayed as follows:

</pre>
The Air Temple level features intermittent electrical discharges which will 
destroy both worn items and those in the pack, as well as damaging PCs without 
good shock resistance or immunity. It is highly advisable to leave precious
non-artifact items on the level above or below the Air Temple. To attack the
temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters. The presence of the
secret doors is actually helpful, since ideally the PC can take on the monsters 
outside of the temple first, without alerting the air elementals and grues. 
The air elementals are very tough with many hitpoints and the ability to breathe 
lightning bolts, which are another way the PC's equipment can be destroyed. The 
grues and demons are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee attack that 
has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them eventually
- a good reason to develop the PC's missile weapon skills. Invisibility is
tremendously useful. Only the chaos servants and Yulgash see invisible.<p>

<a name="3h1"></a><h4>3.17.1 Yulgash, the Master Summoner <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 8, Hits: 600, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d50, Speed: 100.</pre>
As befits his name, Yulgash is liable to summon anything up to and including 
great wyrms and ancient karmic dragons. Killing him as soon as he is aware of
the PCs presence is therefore a top priority. Yulgash is able to teleport if not
on a level that prohibits it (such as the Air Temple itself), has a corrupting melee 
attack and is a spellcaster. He is vulnerable to humanoid slayers.<p>

Yulgash holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Air, greater identified as follows:
<pre>
------------------ Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} -------------------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +10.
