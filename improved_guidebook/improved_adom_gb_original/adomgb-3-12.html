<h3>Eternal Guardian <tt>@</tt></h3>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 30, PV: 60, Hits: 2400, Attacks: 3, Damage: 5d8+5, Speed: 100.</pre>

The Eternal Guardian is found one or two levels before the Casino. He guards the
down staircase on the level. He only allows peaceful passage of PCs if they are
wearing the Ring of the High Kings, obtainable from the Tomb of the High Kings
(section <a href="adomgb-2-12.html">2.12</a>). It is definitely possible
to pass him without the ring, although
it presents special problems. The obvious tactic of teleporting him away from
the stairs does not work, as he is resistant to teleportation. Trying to kill
him in melee or with missiles is more or less pointless, since he reincarnates
even if the PC manages to kill him, which is very difficult. His hitpoints are extremely
high even for a boss and his attacks are penetrating. Furthermore, his
reincarnations will be leveled.
If a PC wants to pass him without the RotHK, it is best to make him angry such that
he chases the PC, followed by a quick teleport to the down stairs and descent.<p>

Fighting multiple copies of the Eternal Guardian is a
recipe for suicide. Or a recipe for lots of experience, if the PC is fast enough.
The Eternal Guardian is not especially fast, so hit and run tactics can be used.
He is vulnerable to humanoid slayers or ball spells. It takes a lot of either
to bring him down though.<p>

Even if the PC manages to pass him without the Ring of the High Kings, the
shortcut to the surface through Darkforge
(see section <a href="adomgb-3-14.html">3.14</a>) will not work in the
down direction - a distinct disadvantage.<p>

It is possible to anger the Eternal Guardian, kill his hostile copies and still
pass peacefully by showing the Ring of the High Kings to the nonhostile copy
that remains on the stairs. This can be used to exploit the Eternal Guardian
for experience.<p>
