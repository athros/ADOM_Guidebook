<h3>Darkforge</h3>
<A HREF="adomgb-2-4-pic.html" target="blank">Color map</A><p>
Darkforge is an important location in the game. It is not a location for low level PCs,
unless they have on demand controlled teleportation, a willingness to risk an instadeath
from a single hit from a steel golem, and are spoiled silly with a complete map. ;-)<p>
<pre>Steel golem: Level: 1, DV: 8, PV: 35, Hits: 180, Attacks: 1, Damage: 5d10+5, Speed: 100.</pre>

The entrance to Darkforge is described as "A long and non-descript tunnel." The first
level of the dungeon is not particularly dangerous except for the presence of a steel
golem guarding the down staircase. Steel golems are very tough monsters for a mid-level
PC. If the PC has trouble with the steel golem guarding the down staircase, flee. There
are many more guarding Darkforge itself. Upon entering Darkforge, the message "You smell
the reek of sulphur, steel and oil." is generated. The steel golems that guard Darkforge
are unlife and thus immune to Mindcraft. They are vulnerable to missiles of construct
slaying, but it is almost unheard of to find enough such ammo to take them all out by
this point in the game. They are vulnerable to lightning, from the spell or wand,
although it will take many castings or charges to kill all of them. Steel golems will
shrug off many lightning attacks, but can eventually be killed this way. They breathe fire,
so both the PC and his equipment need to be protected from fire. Many players will attempt
Darkforge just before assaulting the Tower of Eternal Flames, in order to determine whether
their PC has a good chance in the ToEF.<p>

<!--Darkforge is a very good way of gaining experience levels for PCs that can deal with the
steel golems. A typical non-troll PC that manages to clear Darkforge of the initially
generated steel golems will gain at least five experience levels - very useful when about
to attempt the ToEF.<p>-->

The layout of the water squares in the pool room may help to keep golems or Kherab from attacking.
If so, teleporting in and out is one way to attack them. Leaving the last group of golems near the
Crown of Science alone will help to control monster generation in Darkforge. It has been observed
that the steel horrors that are eventually generated tend to critically hit harder than the golems.<p>

Below is a map of Darkforge.

Due west of the starting position is a collection of pools, usually 6-10
in number, the only guaranteed pools in the game (excepting a dangerous pool in the Stone Circle).
Many players visit these pools in hopes of getting a wish or other valuable intrinsics. Further
west of that is a large cache of armor. These pieces of armor can be of quite high quality,
including dragon scale armor, eternium pieces, or occasionally artifacts. There is another cache
of weapons in the south side of the map, featuring a number of weapons of similar quality.
The treasure rooms themselves are accessed from trapped hallways connecting to central room complete
with nine forges, and Kherab, the dwarven artificer.
The west side of the map contains a small cache of gold, and a final set of steel golems guarding
the shortcut to the Caverns of Chaos. These stairs allow the player quick access to D:32 or D:33,
but must be ascended from the CoC side first before they can be used. A secret room in this same hallway
also holds the Crown of science (the lone <tt>[</tt>), an artifact that provides a significant boost to Learning,
as well as fire immunity, but is autocursing and dooms the wearer. The crown is surrounded by traps and
has yet another steel golem on it.<p>
<pre>
--------------------- crown of science [+4, +8] {Le+9} ---------------------

Weight: 65s

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +8.

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It modifies your learning attribute by +9.
It is a permanently cursed item.
It grants bad luck.
Wearing it makes you doomed.
It grants immunity to fire.
</pre>

It is not wise to spend inordinate amounts of time in Darkforge - for example smithing.
Darkforge has a higher than normal rate of background corruption.<p>

Monsters who can be generated in Darkforge consist of the following:
steel golem, steel horror, animated armor, steel zombie, dwarven chaos knight.<p>

<a name="241"></a><h4>2.4.1 Kherab, the dwarven artificer <tt>h</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 35, Hits: 350, Attacks: 3, Damage: 4d7+19, Speed: 100.</pre>
Kherab is presumably the creator of
the steel golems, steel horrors and animated armors found in Darkforge. He is quite
tough, with hitpoints numbering in the hundreds and a powerful melee attack.
He is immune to fire, sees in Darkness, shrugs bolt spells quite well and has very fast
regeneration. He is vulnerable to poison.
He holds two items necessary for Smithing: a hammer (an eternium warhammer) and an anvil.
He also carries a crossbow and eternium quarrels. He is the source of two quests outlined below.<p>

<a name="242"></a><h4>2.4.2 Kherab's quests and their rewards</h4>
Kherab is the source of two chaotic quests. The first is to kill Guth'Alak, the druid
found in Terinyo. This of course removes Guth'Alak as a source of potions of cure
corruption and as the source of the Unicorn quest. Depending on how it is accomplished,
the entire village of Terinyo may become hostile as well. If this happens, it may
destroy any chance the PC has to obtain the TotRR. The reward for this quest is the
corrupting artifact shield of raw steel.
<pre>
---------------- shield of raw steel (+2) [+18, +12] {To+8} ----------------

Weight: 180s

When worn it modifies DV by +18 and PV by +12.

When used in melee combat it grants a +2 bonus to hit and causes 1d6 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d6
points of damage.

It modifies your toughness attribute by +8.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants immunity to fire.
It grants immunity to cold attacks.
</pre>

The second quest is to kill Thrundarr, the
village elder in Dwarftown. This can have all sorts of negative effects as well,
including turning all of Dwarftown hostile and the killing of the Demented Ratling.
The reward for this quest is the corrupting amulet of raw steel.
<pre>
------------------- amulet of raw steel [+3, +3] {Pe+12} -------------------

Weight: 10s

When worn it modifies DV by +3 and PV by +3.

When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It modifies your perception attribute by +12.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It grants resistance to sleep attacks.
It grants resistance to stunning.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
</pre>

The quest rewards are useful only because they are artifacts. They can be fed to the
Demented Ratling, for instance. The shield is the best in the game at [+18, +12] and To +8,
but it cannot be used for the whole game due to its corrupting nature. However, it also grants
fire immunity, so it is an option for PCs that need its properties to help with the ToEF.
These "rewards" are not really rewards. Kherab is an evil chaotic being and wants the
PC dead. Giving away corrupting artifacts is his way of trying to accomplish this.<p>
