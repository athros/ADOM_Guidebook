<h3>Scintillating Cave</h3>
The Scintillating Cave is a cave that appears in the northwest section of the map (next to the Minotaur Maze)
once the player has completed the quest to kill Filk, the quickling bard.<p>

The Scintillating Cave features eight cavernous levels, with all the inherent dangerous associated with these,
including open tension rooms, and high monster generation featuring very dangerous monsters: ancient karmic dragons,
greater molochs and emperor lichs are common. It is best to simply get to the down staircases as quickly as possible unless
the PC is an absolute walking tank by this time. All of the levels of the Scintillating Cave feature
a dangerously high corruption rate, so it is generally not advised to spend inordinate amounts of time
fighting monsters here. The last level is particularly corrupting, is not cavernous, and is home to the powerful
Emperor Moloch. Killing the Emperor Moloch will give the player the crumpled scroll, which is necessary to obtain the
Trident of the Red Rooster. Note that the crumpled scroll is not an artifact, and thus is vulnerable to damage
from fire, water, etc. It is recommended that the player read the crumpled scroll at the earliest opportunity,
since this will allow the crumpled scroll to be rewritten using a magical writing set.<p>

Altars may occasionally spawn in the Scintillating Cave; however, these may also be destroyed by rampaging molochs.<p>

<a name="2k1"></a><h4>2.20.1 Emperor Moloch <tt>&amp;</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 3, PV: 200, Hits: 1395, Attacks: 1, Damage: 36d12+12, Speed: 85.</pre>
Emperor Moloch is the guardian of the crumpled scroll. He is by far the physically
strongest and toughest monster in the game, with a PV of 200 and the capability to deal hundreds of damage in a single
attack. Engaging him in melee is thus extremely risky. Since like all molochs he punches through armor, the PC's
only defense against his attacks is DV; having extremely high HP is also a must for the PC. Phase daggers,
or even better a weapon with the 'of penetration' suffix, might be necessary to damage him; these weapons should
be blessed to further increase damage output. Otherwise the PC will need a powerful weapon of demon or humanoid
slaying, high effectivity ball spells or greater telekinetic blast. In addition, the level he resides on is massively
corrupting. He must be killed quickly or lured off the level.<p>

Whilst it <i>is</i> possible to kill the moloch in straight up melee combat, ranged tactics may be a good idea
for PCs lacking stellar endurance and/or Strength scores; particularly since the moloch is easy to outrun and
has no ranged attacks. He is immune to fire and cold, though; and presumably has a high chance to shrug off
other magical bolts. PCs relying instead on archery should use their stocks of blessed penetrating ammo against him.<p>

Note that a wish for "emperor moloch", whilst he is still alive, will instead spawn about 20 hostile greater
molochs. It is also worth noting that as well as the crumpled scroll, the moloch is also guaranteed to drop
his moloch armor when slain.
