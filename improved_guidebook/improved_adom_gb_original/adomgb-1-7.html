<h3>Druid Dungeon</h3>
The Druid Dungeon is a dungeon southeast of Terinyo that will appear after the Kill Keethrax quest
has been assigned. It consists of seven levels, with the corrupted evil druid Keethrax living on the bottom level.<p>

Much like the Village Dungeon, the Druid Dungeon does not have most dungeon features; altars and tension rooms
may be generated, but herbs, forges, etc. generally may not be. The bottom level is unique in that, aside from
Keethrax, only animals may be found on this floor. Unlike other places, animals here are hostile towards PCs of
the Druid class. Additionally, animals on Keethrax's level can't be calmed (using the Calm Monster spell results
in the target "ignoring the spell"); and possibly can't be tamed.<p>

The following animals are generated on DD:7: cave bear,
cave fisher,
cave lion,
cave lizard,
cave tiger,
cobra,
dire wolf,
fire beetle,
fire lizard,
giant bat,
giant centipede,
giant frog,
giant lizard,
giant raccoon,
giant rat,
giant slug,
giant spider,
huge bat,
hyena,
jackal,
large snake,
large spider,
rabid dog,
rat,
rattlesnake,
silver wolf,
tarantula,
viper,
wild cat,
wolf.<p>

<a name="171"></a><h4>1.7.1 Keethrax, the black druid <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 4, Hits: 72, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d3+1, Speed: 125.</pre>
Keethrax's stats are directly proportional to your level when first entering DD:7.
As a druid, he maintains a contingent of hostile animals on the final level. These will include felines (see
section <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#092">0.9.2</a>) and giant slugs (nasty acid breathers, but their corpses are a source
of acid immunity). He is vulnerable to acid and magic missiles, but little else
in the way of magic. He can however be stunned via the Stun Ray spell or the wand, paralyzed with a wand of paralyzation,
and blinded with a cursed potion of invisibility.
He casts Darkness, can see in darkness, attacks with missiles (source of sling bullets)
and glowing balls, heals himself, while he can drain attributes and use curses in melee range. He has a corrupting
melee attack. All of this makes a formidable enemy for PCs less than experience level ten. Some players
regard him as an out-of-depth opponent and defer this quest until later in the game.
He carries an artifact, the Black Torc, which is a decent missile weapon but
permanently cursed. It is good fodder for the Demented Ratling (see section <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#358">3.5.8</a>).
<pre>
------------------------ black torc [+4, +2] (+10 spd) ------------------------

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +2.

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+2
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +2 bonus to hit and
causes 2d6+2 points of damage.

It is an undead slayer.
It is a permanently cursed item.
This weapon returns when thrown.
It modifies your speed by +10.
It grants resistance to fire.
It grants resistance to cold.
It grants bad luck.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.
</pre>

Keethrax always leaves a corpse. Picking up his corpse is a chaotic act, but
Guth'Alak will reward non-chaotic PCs with a potion of cure corruption in exchange
for returning Keethrax's corpse to him. Eating the corpse will corrupt (nearly one full corruption).
It also results in -1000 alignment drop and attribute changes: +2 Le, +1 To, +3 Ma and -4 Wi.<p>
