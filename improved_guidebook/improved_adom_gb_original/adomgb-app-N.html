<h3>Appendix N - Wishing - suggestions and warnings</h3>
<HR size = "2"><p>

The <a href="adomman-R.html#R2">ADOM Manual</a> provides basic introduction to Wishing.<p>

<a name="wobt"><h3>Obtaining a wish</h3>
There are five ways of obtaining a wish in Adom. Note that it is impossible to wish for any
of the first three items on the list, making wishing for wishes a fool's game. Wands of wishing
cannot be recharged by any known means. Casting the Wish spell always drains 10 points of a
random attribute. Getting a wish from a wand of wonder is safe, because the needed PP exceeding
the PC's available PP comes from some unknown source. The -10 drain still occurs though.<p>
<ul>
<li>a blessed ring of djinni summoning
<li>a wand of wishing
<li>the Wish spell, which can be learned from a Spellbook of wish, a potion of wonder, a wand of wonder, or certain class powers (eg. level 18 Bards)
<li>randomly from a wand of wonder
<li>randomly from a pool 
</ul><p>

If there is no room for the djinni to appear, you rub the ring... but you only hear a groaning voice "There's not enough room to appear!"
The ring is wasted.<p> 

<a name="wtop"></a><h3>What to wish for</h3>
<b>Items:</b> amulet of life saving if pre-Khelavaster, red dragon scale mails especially if pre-ToEF,
pairs of (guarantees plurality) seven league boots, scrolls of chaos resistance, magical writing sets, 
eternium tower shields, potions of exchange, rings of slaying, rings of regeneration, wands of teleportation,
spellbooks of acid ball, bracers of resistance.<p>

<b>Skills:</b> Concentration for magic; Find Weakness for melee<p>

<b>Weapons:</b> phase daggers (if no penetrating weapons are found), boomerangs; in general weapons
are not a wise thing to use a wish on, there are plenty available in the game<p>

<a name="wdet"></a><h3>Details</h3>
Wishes can yield any skill except for Alertness (which, when wished
for, increases Perception) and Healing (which, when wished for, heals the
PC). Attributes can also be wished for - although, wishing for 'learning' yields
potions of learning - wish for 'knowledge' to increase Learning directly.
Appearance has to be wished for as 'beauty' and Perception as 'alertness'.
The size of the attribute increase depends on the attribute: St - 1d4+1, Le - 2d3,
Wi - 1d6+2, Dx - 2d2+1, To - 1d4+1, Ch - 3d3, Ap - 4d2, Ma - 1d4+1, Pe - 2d3.<p>

A "manual of bridge building" can be wished for and the PC is able to learn
the skill by reading it. Wishing for "manuals of bridge building" results
in the strange flux message then Nothing Happens.<p>

If the PC wants to increase Learning, wishing for crystals of knowledge
is better than wishing for potions of learning since blessed CoK's increase
Learning by 1d2, you get three with one wish, and you can bless multiple
CoK's with one potion of holy water, whereas you get two potions of learning,
both of which take a potion of holy water to bless. With any decent kind of
luck, the CoK's should bring at least 4, 5 or even 6 extra points to Learning.
However, CoKs will only raise Learning to about 25.<p>

Wishing for the plural form of certain items results in a message:<p>
<pre>
A voice in your mind booms...
"*ONE* SHALL BE ENOUGH!"
Your equipment feels heavier.
</pre>
Items in this category include amulets of life saving, girdles of giant
strength, potions of gain attributes, whips of the snake, whips of slaughtering,
swords of sharpness. Potions of -attribute- can only be
obtained two at a time. Other wishes results in 2d2 items or stacks.<p>

Fish can only be wished for in its raw form, as "piece of fish meat" or "pieces of fish meat".
Wishing for fried fish gives regular fish instead.<p>

<a name="wspd"></a><h3>Wishing for speed</h3>
Stephen White has studied this in some detail and posted the following to RGRA on March 7th, 2002:<p>

<pre>
First I will mention that during the following testing I was
careful to look out for things like base modification of
speed due to burden or hunger status - I was always not even
burdened, and always of no specific hunger status, i.e. not
satiated or hungry, just normal.

OK, I just tested this out. I wished for "potions of boost speed"
10 times. I got only two potions twice, three potions six times,
and four potions twice, so we can assume the average is three
per wish.

I blessed them all, and drank them one at a time, allowing my
speed to return to normal between each one. The lowest speed
boost given was 21 points, which occured three times. The
highest was 47, acheived just once. The average overall was
30.8 speed points from one blessed potion.

This gives an overall total (assuming three potions from an
average wish, and average gain from each) of 92.4 points.

Then I tried wishing for "speed" directly, 12 times. I let my
speed return to normal after each, and took account of the
permanent increase of 1 point left over after the boost wears
off. The minimum boost I received was 150 points, the maximum
was 248 points. The overall average was 214.2 points.

So, this is pretty conclusive - it's best to wish for "speed"
directly. It's <i>possible</i> to gain more by using potions, if
you get 4 from your wish, and a decent gain from each, compared
to a quite unlucky wish for "speed", but in general wishing
for speed directly is almost guaranteed to give the bigger
increase.
</pre><p>

The original context of the thread was in regard to techniques useful when fighting Andor Drakon. High
speed is also useful when fighting Srraxxarrakex, the Emperor Moloch, or other monsters the PC just doesn't
want to be hit by.<p>

In the following table, the game's direct response is [in square brackets].<p>

[2] Wishing for a raider lord and killing him before Tywat Pare assigns the quest results in no reward
from Tywat Pare, other than the 300 gold pieces for the corpse. Furthermore, he will not assign
the quest. If the PC gets the quest, wishes for a raider lord and kills him, Tywat Pare acknowledges
the kill and gives the usual reward.<p>

[3] Interestingly, wished-for ratling guardians are as immobile as those in the HMV and respond with the
same message about guarding the city when <tt>C</tt>hatted with.<p>

[4] Wished-for ancient karmic wyrms are confused. They are immobile, think they are Sharad-Waador
and ask the PC to "Stand on the stairs... then we'll talk."<p>

[5] A wished-for dwarven mystic always responds with the "Ye art doomed!" message and then disappears when
<tt>C</tt>hatted with. The PC is not in fact doomed. See section <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#354">3.5.4</a>.<p>

[6] If the PC has received the puppy quest from the Tiny Girl, wishing for a Cute Dog and delivering it to
her satisfies the quest requirement. If the PC has <i>not</i> received the quest, wishing for a Cute Dog
may well result in one that is hostile. This causes an amusing scenario, to say the least, in Terinyo.<p>

[7] Most of the wished-for uniques just work normally. Dwarven smith offers Smithing services for gold, even without 
a forge. Dwarven weaponmaster offers training. Dwarven innkeeper offers a rumor and an ale for 1 gp. Grizzled gladiator
offers training in exchange for the Golden Gladius. Cloaked ratling sells keys. Ratling Dealer sells climbing sets. 
Half-orc bouncers grunt: "Ask da boss." Old Barbarians and master thieves will usually be hostile - can be calmed down, 
but won't offer their services.<p>
