<a name="0e1"></a><h4>0.14.1 Recharging wands <tt>\</tt></h4>
There are many ways to recharge a depleted wand. The common ways are to dip <tt>!</tt> the wand
into an appropriate potion or <tt>r</tt>ead a scroll of charging. Only the type of potion and
its status affects the number of charges. The type, status and rusty/nonrusty nature of
the wand do not matter.
See the table below for some results compiled by Petri Sihvola:<p>

<a name="0e11"></a><table border=1><caption>Recharging wands</caption>

</table><p>

Remember that a potentially endless supply of booze is available from beggars in Lawenilothehl.
Give them 50 gold pieces, then <tt>C</tt>hat with them and they will often drop a potion of booze.
Only one per beggar, though, so those who have given up their potion need to be killed (alignment hit)
or led into the wilderness to encourage more beggar generation. Get rid of all the other random monsters
in the town to further encourage monster generation.<p>

Potions of raw mana do not work. Note that potions of mana can be used to permanently
increase the PCs Mana attribute; the player may want to save them for that purpose.
Wizards can also recharge wands at level 32, only once per wand though.
Wands of wishing can't be recharged. For these, you'll want to use the chance to wrench
a final charge from the wand, destroying it. See also potions of raw chaos below.<p>

<a name="0e2"></a><h4>0.14.2 Huge rocks and anvils <tt>*</tt> <tt>]</tt></h4>
These heavy items have a nice use: crashing doors. Throw one at a door and
enjoy the sight of a broken door before you. This is not guaranteed; it seems
to be Strength dependent. There is a very nice side
benefit to this: any trap that the door was protected with is destroyed
along with the door. The trap does not go off as it is destroyed.<p>

In addition, huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills.
Whenever an ant wants to escape, you get a message like "The uncursed huge rock
(-10, 10d6) seems to be shaking.". Eventually the huge rock is destroyed
("Something from below destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!")
and ants can come out of the hole again. Sometimes this happens after
only a few turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple huge
rocks are destroyed one after the other and thus last longer than a
single one.<p>

<a name="0e3"></a><h4>0.14.3 Statues <tt>]</tt></h4>
If your PC is really, really buff, a statue can be wielded as a melee
weapon, but the real use for statues is to <tt>k</tt>ick it until it breaks down,
making it yield a magical wand. Statues can be generated by petrifying
enemies. If a PC has a PV below four, she will take damage from kicking statues (and walls).<p>

Stephen White has done some research on
the B/U/C status of statues re wand generation. His PC kicked 200 statues
with each status to pieces. The results were as follows:
<ul>
<li>blessed statues: 62 wands generated, about 1/3<br>
<li>uncursed statues: 17 wands generated, about 1/10<br>
<li>cursed statues: 3 wands generated, about 1/100<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0e4"></a><h4>0.14.4 Potions of raw chaos <tt>!</tt></h4>
Items can be dipped in potions of raw chaos in order to transform them into new ones, but will not make wands of wishing
or rings of djinni summoning. Everything created will be cursed. Dipping items (other than artifacts)
into a PoRC will transform it into a random item of the same type - useful for brass items. Equipped items are removed
(even if cursed) and cursed. There is a chance of spilling the potion, though, which corrupts the PC (spilling happens if
1d(Dx+10) &gt; Dx). Worse is the possibility of transforming an item into the exact same item. This causes an explosion
which badly corrupts the PC, about 5 corruptions (100d100 CP's), and causes 10d30 of damage. Needless to say, this can
kill a low-level PC. Dipping a scroll of chaos resistance into potion of raw chaos causes a massive explosion of 13d13
damage, producing death message 'was ripped apart when confronting Order and Chaos'.<p>

PoRC will only create items of a danger level that corresponds to the level on which you dip the item.
For creating an amulet of lifesaving, you should dip amulets on DL2. Your odds are poor - 1.08%. You can safely dip amulets of balance,
free action, health, hunger, luck, chaos, order, speed, teleport control, cold hearts, water breathing, silver tongue, and mana.<p>

Wands dipped into a PoRC will turn into a wand with a different number of charges. This is one way to recharge wands with
0 charges left. The type of wand, however, is unpredictable.<p>

A heap of items that are dipped into a potion of raw chaos will always transform into a single item. Potions of raw chaos
can be created by dipping any corrupting artifact (those containing the essence of chaos and corruption + Moon Sickle)
into any ordinary potion.<p>

<a name="0e5"></a><h4>0.14.5 Potions of exchange <tt>!</tt></h4>
In addition to swapping attributes, these can polymorph monsters when thrown. Blessed potions can polymorph items to another of the
same type. Spellbooks are always transformed into non-spellbooks and vice versa.
The item produced will be appropriate for the danger level where the dipping takes place. This is the basis of
ring-based wish engines. Once one has blessed potions of exchange stacks of 19 rings can be dipped, potentially producing
19 rings of djinni summoning. These in turn are enough to produce 57 more potions of exchange on average. Since used rings
of djinni summoning become brass rings, additional rings do not have to be wished for. The PC may have to throw in some wishes
for potions of water to keep blessing the potions of exchange. Of course once the engine starts there are enough spare wishes
to actually get some things that matter as well. :-).<p>

<a name="0e6"></a><h4>0.14.6 Regeneration of HP and PP</h4>
When drinking potions of insight or casting the Revelation spell, there
is some information about Power Point and Hit Point regeneration. Those
two values lie between 5 and 200: the lower the number, the faster the
regeneration. But there are 2 variables connected to regeneration: RegenRate and RegenAmount.
RegenRate is how often (in turns) you heal - this value is revealed via revelation or insight;
RegenAmount is how much - this value is completely hidden.<p>

Regeneration occurs at the same rate whether walking around or resting.
RegenRate is measured in turns, not game time. High speed or seven league
boots lead to exactly the same regeneration rate in turns. Thus regeneration
is faster with respect to game time if the PC is fast or walking around with
seven league boots. If a PC with low walking energy cost wants to spend the
minimum amount of game time regenerating, the best bet is to walk around
while regenerating. The Cursed, Doomed, Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics do not make a
difference for regeneration purposes. Hunger status has no effect on regeneration.<p>

<a name="0e61"></a><h4>0.14.6.1 HP regeneration</h4>
<table border=1><caption>Natural HP regeneration</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th>NaturalRegen
<tr><td>Human, Hurthling <td>50
<tr><td>Dark Elf <td>70
<tr><td>Gray Elf <td>65
<tr><td>High Elf <td>60
<tr><td>Gnome <td>48
<tr><td>Dwarf <td>45
<tr><td>Orc <td>40
<tr><td>Drakeling <td>30
<tr><td>Troll <td>20
<tr><td>Healer <td>halved
<tr><td>Most PCs <td>-1 (based on Toughness?)
<tr><td>Some PCs <td>-1 once more (based on Toughness?)
</table><p>

The modifiers are applied in the order listed here.
E.g. Trollish Healers with exceptional Toughness get a starting
regeneration time of 20 / 2 - 1 - 1 = 8.<p>

RegenRate = Max (2, NaturalRegen *10 if Sick *0.8 if Healthy talent *1/0.5/0.125 if wearing C/U/B necklace
of rapid healing) *10 if wearing rotting armor.<p>

The Healing skill provides additional chance for regeneration every turn: (Healing / (1200 *4.67 if Sick))%.
So with 100 Healing the chance is 0.83% per turn (0.39% if sick). The Candle birthsign provides additional regeneration every 12 turns.<p>

RegenAmount = 1 + ClassBonus + CandleBonus + RoomBonus. ClassBonus is 1 for lvl 6-11 Healers, lvl 32+ Bards, lvl 32+
Druids in wilderness, 2 for lvl 12+ Healers, 0 otherwise. CandleBonus is 1 for Candle borns, 0 otherwise. RoomBonus is 3
if in "refreshing" room, 1 if in "herbs and antiseptics" room, 0 otherwise.<p>

Separate from these RegenRate and RegenAmount calculations, every piece of regenerating equipment (except amulet of rapid healing) grants
additional 1 HP per turn. The regenerating corruption grants additional 1 HP every 5 turns, but 1 scar every 1000 regenerations (-1 Dx or -1 Ap).<p>

All HP regeneration is stopped, if the PC is in the "devoid of all life" room, or in water without water breathing.<p>

<a name="0e62"></a><h4>0.14.6.2 PP regeneration</h4>
<table border=1><caption>Natural PP regeneration</caption>
<tr><th>Condition<th>NaturalRegen
<tr><td>Human, Drakeling<td>50
<tr><td>Troll<td>100
<tr><td>Dwarf<td>90
<tr><td>Hurthling<td>60
<tr><td>Orc<td>55
<tr><td>High Elf<td>40
<tr><td>Gnome<td>40
<tr><td>Dark Elf<td>30
<tr><td>Gray Elf<td>25
<tr><td>Most PCs<td>-1 (based on Mana?)
<tr><td>Some PCs<td>-1 once more (based on Mana?)
</table><p>

PP regeneration is applied every turm if one the following checks pass:
<ul>
<li>TurnNumber mod NaturalRegen = 0 (once every NaturalRegen turns)
<li>Concentration &gt; 1d500
<li>Concentration &gt;= 75 and Concentration &gt; 1d500
<li>Concentration &gt;= 90 and Concentration &gt; 1d500
<li>Concentration = 100 and Concentration &gt; 1d500 (100 Concentration provides about 59% overall chance)
<li>Charged talent and 3%
<li>the PC is in magical island in Terinyo and 100% (means the island grants PP regeneration every turn)
<li>Mana battery corruption and 10%
</ul><p>

RegenAmount = 1 + ClassBonus. ClassBonus is 1 for lvl 40+ Bards and lvl 12+ Druids in wilderness, 0 otherwise.<p>

All PP regeneration is stopped if wearing anti-magical armor.<p>

<a name="0e63"></a><h4>0.14.6.3 Potions of troll blood and raw mana <tt>!</tt></h4>
Natural regeneration can be affected by drinking potions of troll blood (for
hit points) or potions of raw mana (for power points).
These potions cannot lower RegenRate below 5 turns or raise it above 200.
Their effectiveness depends on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:<p>

<a name="0e631"></a><table border=1><caption>Potions of troll blood and raw mana</caption>
<tr><th>Potion status <th>Modification to RegenRate
<tr><td>Blessed <td>-4d3
<tr><td>Uncursed <td>-2d3
<tr><td>Cursed <td>+2d3
</table><p>

Bottom line: always bless your potions of troll blood or raw mana.<p>

As can be seen, many blessed potions of troll blood will get you more
than good Healing skill, but having Healing at 100 is best. Likewise,
potions of raw mana are nice, but not as important as having a high
Concentration skill.<p>

<a name="0e64"></a><h4>0.14.6.4 Troll corpses <tt>%</tt></h4>
There are four types of troll corpses (troll, troll berserker, troll
chief, troll king). They all yield either of two messages when eaten by
a non-Troll:
<a name="0e641"></a><ol type="a">
<li>"Urg! Foul meat! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
<li>"Urg! Foul meat!"
</ol><p>

Message a. indicates that natural HP regeneration decreased by one<br>
Message b. indicates that natural HP regeneration did not change<p>

For Troll PCs, the messages are slightly modified:
<a name="0e642"></a><ol type="a">
<li>"Yum! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
<li>"Yum!"
</ol><p>

The behaviour is the same: a. decreases natural HP regeneration, b. does not.<p>

No corpse can reduce the regeneration time below 6. Trying this always
gives b. message. This differs from potions of
troll blood, which always result in the "Your blood suddenly curses
faster..." message, even if the regeneration time is already minimal.
Note that the lower threshold is 6, unlike the threshold for potions of
troll blood, which is 5. This means that Trolls, who cannot make use of
potions of troll blood, cannot lower their regeneration time to 5,
unlike the other races.<p>

The probabilities of getting a decrease in regeneration time depends
only on the B/U/C status of the corpse. Specifically, it does not
depend on:
<a name="0e643"></a><ul>
<li>current regeneration time (no difference between the lowest
eligible value 7 and the unrealistically high value 200)
<li>PC race (Human vs. Troll)
<li>cooked/uncooked status
<li>type of troll corpse (troll, troll berserker, troll chief, troll king)
</ul><p>

Results indicate that blessed corpses work in 100% of the cases
(although, like all corpses, they cannot lower it below 6), and uncursed
or cursed corpses work in 50% of the cases. There was no observable
difference between uncursed and cursed corpses:
<a name="0e644"></a><ul>
<li>94 blessed troll corpses: 94x decrease
<li>621 uncursed troll corpses: 314x decrease, 307x no decrease
<li>361 cursed troll corpses: 187x decrease, 174x no decrease
</ul><p>

There was no difference in weight or satiation value of the various kinds
of troll corpses. All corpses weigh 240s if not cooked, irrespective of
B/U/C (rotting) status, and 228s (= 5% less) if cooked, again irrespective
of B/U/C (rotting) status.<p>

An uncursed corpse yields 500 units of satiation (like a large ration).
This is doubled if the corpse is cooked (presumably this holds for other
corpses too, but this needs further verification). The resulting value
is modified by +25% for blessed corpes and -50% for cursed corpses, just
like for other food items. So, e.g. a blessed cooked troll chief corpse
gives 500 * 2 * 1.25 = 1250 units of satiation.<p>

<a name="0e645"></a><b>Summary</b>
<ul>
<li>item: [troll/troll berserker/troll chief/troll king] corpse
<li>weight: 240s (-5% if cooked)
<li>nutritional value: 500 (*2 if cooked, *1.25 if blessed, *0.5 if cursed)
<li>effect when eaten [blessed]: If natural HP regeneration is &gt;= 7, it is reduced by 1
<li>effect when eaten [uncursed/cursed]: If natural HP regeneration is &gt;= 7, it is reduced by 1 with a probability of 50%
<li>message when eaten [non-troll PC]: "Urg! Foul meat!"
<li>message when eaten [Troll PC]: "Yum!"
<li>additional message if and only if natural HP regeneration was reduced: "Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
</ul><p>

<a name="0e7"></a><h4>0.14.7 Seven league boots <tt>[</tt></h4>
Seven league boots can dramatically reduce the time needed to walk around
in the wilderness, depending on their blessed/uncursed/cursed status:<p>
<ul>
<li>blessed: time needed for walking is divided by 6
<li>uncursed: time needed for walking is divided by 3
<li>cursed: time needed for walking is multiplied by 2
</ul><p>

Blessed/uncursed/cursed seven league boots also alter the base energy cost
for movement outside the wilderness from 1000 to 500/750/1500, respectively.
The Long Stride talent stacks, reducing base energy cost further.
Seven league boots should be blessed immediately. They enable the PC to
outrun anything other than quicklings. Consequently, some players regard
seven league boots as the most important item in the game, and will use a
wish to obtain them, if necessary.<p>

<a name="0e8"></a><h4>0.14.8 Stethoscopes <tt>]</tt></h4>
<tt>U</tt>sing a stethoscope, you can determine a monster's statistics
precisely. Furthermore, using a stethoscope, you can easily find secret
doors: scan a wall block, and if it "sounds hollow", it's a secret door.
In addition to monsters and secret doors, stethoscopes can also be used on closed
doors to find out the number of monsters behind it. The messages are:<p>

<a name="0e81"></a><table border=1><caption>Stethoscope messages</caption>
<tr><th>Message<th>Meaning
<tr><td>Silence. <td> corridor (this message is shown even if the corridor is full of monsters, so be warned)
<tr><td>You hear nothing. <td> empty room
<tr><td>You hear some low-volume sounds. <td> 1 monster in the room
<tr><td>You hear some sounds. <td> 2-3 monsters
<tr><td>You hear many sounds. <td> 4-8 monsters
<tr><td>You hear lots of sounds. <td> 9 or more monsters (tension rooms and rooms filled with breeders or summoned creatures also give this message)
</table><p>

See section <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f3">0.15.3</a> concerning a Healer's special ability with stethoscopes.<p>

<a name="0e9"></a><h4>0.14.9 Safe places to store items</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Top line of the Terinyo map</b><br>
The only monster in Terinyo that can step on the top line is the sheriff,
and he can easily be lured to the first level of the Puppy Cave. It is then
100% secure. Skriek can step on the top line as well, if one lures him there.<p>

<li><b>Locked rooms</b><br>
Locked rooms are one of the safest places to leave items in ADOM.
With the current state of the monster inventory system (they can
pick up items but not use them), a monster will never be able to
unlock a door. Several monsters can smash doors, however. Some
monsters (balors spring to mind) can teleport into locked rooms.<p>

<li><b>Old Barbarian's glade</b><br>
The Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items. He is
the only monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly
generated is going to run away with the PC's stuff. If the PC leaves
items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will not have time to find
them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

<li><b>Mad Minstrel's clearing</b><br>
In ADOM 1.0.0, the Mad Minstrel will leave his hut, and will pick up
items. The safety of the storage is therefore similar to the Old
Barbarian's glade. No other monsters are generated in his clearing,
so leaving items far away from the Mad Minstrel should not allow him
time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.<p>

<li><b>Dwarven Mystic's room in Dwarftown</b><br>
The ultimate in security, if the PC has not destroyed it with a wand
of destruction (see section <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#354">3.5.4</a>).
After <tt>C</tt>hatting wih the Dwarven
Mystic, he disappears, leaving a 2 x 2 room that cannot be entered
except by teleportation. Since there are no teleporting monsters
found in Dwarftown (except for the greater daemon - kill it) this is
as safe as storage areas get. Other Dwarftown inhabitants can, in
extremely rare circumstances, be generated in this room. Since they
will be nonhostile, killing them is not a good idea. Teleport them
out if possible. Alternatively, use the Ogre Cave (see below).<p>

<li><b>Ogre Cave in Dwarftown</b><br>
Monster generation there is nonexistent. So once it is
cleared, items can be left anywhere on the level with no chance
that the items will be disturbed.<p>

<li><b>Secret room in the HMV</b><br>
Another room accessible only by teleportation, therefore almost
perfect theoretical security. A monster teleporting into this
room has never been seen. In extremely rare circumstances, however,
monsters can be generated in this room. They may well be hostile,
so killing them is a simple solution. Teleporting them out is a
worthwhile alternative.<p>

<li><b>Sharad-Waador's room</b><br>
Items left in Sharad-Waador's room never seem to be disturbed.
Sharad-Waador never moves from the square where he is initially
generated (unless he is attacked or the PC reneges on the deal to
take the quest), and no time passes on the level between the PC's
departure and reemergence from the blue dragon caves. This is very
important, since the player may want to leave important non-artifact
equipment behind in order to avoid its potential destruction in the
Blue Dragon Caves (see section <a href="adomgb-3-19.html">3.19</a>).<p>
</ul><p>

<a name="0ea"></a><h4>0.14.10 Weight and appearance of objects</h4>
Note the weight of objects. Many valuable objects have a unique weight.
For instance, there is only one type of sword with a weight of 35s, one
amulet weighing 7s, one amulet weighing 8s, one girdle weighing 30s, etc.
In general, lighter items are better. Items with odd, unusual or rare
weights are often better than their more commonly observed counterparts.
Certain special items also have a unique color. Slaying quarrels will
be brown rather than the silver of normal quarrels. Metal-shod quarterstaves
(whether iron-, mithril-, adamantium- or eternium-) are silver; normal
quarterstaves are brown. This is especially important to remember for
eternium-shod quarterstaves, since they have the same weight as wooden
quarterstaves.<p>

<a name="0eb"></a><h4>0.14.11 Dipping stuff into a potion <tt>!</tt></h4>
The command to dip something into a potion is <tt>!</tt>. The various uses of 
dipping stuff into a potion are compiled below:
<ul>
<li>holy water: bless items
<li>unholy water: curse items
<li>water: clear scrolls, rust iron items
<li>poison: poison weapons
<li>raw chaos: exchange items, see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e4">0.14.4</a>
<li>blessed exchange: exchange items, see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e5">0.14.5</a>
<li>oil: waterproof items (cursed potions work almost 100%, uncursed about 50%, blessed almost 0%)
<li>cursed oil of rust removal: rust items
<li>uncursed oil of rust removal: remove rust from items
<li>blessed oil of rust removal: rustproof items
<li>booze, mana, boost mana: recharge wands, see <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e1">0.14.1</a>
</ul><p>

Other potions used for dipping are usualy wasted. The exception is when an item
containing the essence of Chaos and Corruption is dipped into a potion - then the
potion is transformed into raw chaos. The other exception is Alchemy.<p>

When dipping a stack of items into a potion, the amount you can dip depends on the
weight of the item. You can dip:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Dipping
<tr><th>Weight<th>Stack size
<tr><td>1s    <td>19
<tr><td>2s    <td>9
<tr><td>3s    <td>6
<tr><td>4s    <td>4
<tr><td>5-6s  <td>3
<tr><td>7-9s  <td>2
<tr><td>10+s  <td>1
</table><p>

You can always only dip 1 potion of -attribute- or 1 potion of gain attributes.
You can dip missile ammo in stacks of 40.<p>

<a name="0ec"></a><h4>0.14.12 Milking</h4>
Milking refers to abusing the fact that certain monsters shoot or throw some weaponry which cannot be gained by just killing them.
In cases of one handed weapon there is one weapon per monster limit, while missiles can be gained in heaps per single enemy.
Both weapons and missiles have a base type listed below (it is not possible to get arrows/quarrels of -foo- slaying), however,
all available suffixes/prefixes are available. The best strategy is running along a wall of room (with preferably close doors)
allowing monster to follow. Keeping some space between character and monster is recommended but unnecessary. It is better not to
do this in corridors with low level characters as you can easily end in unfavorable position without room to maneuver.<p>

List of all milkable monsters:
<ul>
<li>Orc - orcish knife
<li>Caveman - club
<li>Dwarven guardian - hand axe
<li>(Large) gnoll - battle axe
<li>Orc scorcher, hill orc (sergeant) - orcish spear
<li>Goblin rockthrower, stone giant (lord), ogre, hill giant (chieftain), fire giant (king), troll (berserker/chief/king), earth elemental, wall beast - rock
<li>Greater earth elemental, Ogre Guardian, cyclops - huge rock
<li>Barbarian (leader), kobold, raider (lord) - arrow
<li>Hawkslayer - eternium arrow
<li>Ratling archer - quarrel
<li>Black hurthling, dark elven archer, pixie archer, quickling lord, quickling king - tiny quarrel
<li>(Greater) titan - eternium quarrel
<li>Keethrax - sling bullet
</ul>

Note that barbarian encounters in wilderness can practically net a large amount of arrows (including prefixed ammo) in short time.
Arrow and spear traps can also provide ammunition if triggered multiple time by monsters or by PC with <tt>Ctrl-t</tt> command.
Triggering traps on yourself will always lead to a successful hit, however, with sufficient protection (in terms of PV) damage
to PC may be nullified. Note that spear traps always produce base iron spears without any prefixes/suffixes.<p>

Though not milking in the strictest sense of the term, giant ant workers and other digging monsters can be similarly milked for
rocks by allowing them to dig out large sections of a dungeon level. Casting Earthquake is another way of getting large amounts
of rocks.<p>

<a name="0ed"></a><h4>0.14.13 Losing cursed stuff</h4>
Careful reader shall already know about the many ways of losing cursed stuff. For completeness, here we list all of them.
Note that for trapped armor morphing and destroying are the only ways to get rid of it.<p>

<b>Removing curse</b>
<ul>
<li><tt>r</tt>ead non-cursed scroll of uncursing.
<li><tt>!</tt> dip them item into potion of holy water. You can get holy water by dropping water on coaligned altar if your piety is high
enough, or by dipping normal or unholy water into holy water.
<li><tt>_</tt> pray, your piety must be at least 50 (pleased and up).
<li><tt>Z</tt> cast the Remove Curse spell. Note that a wand or potion of wonder may grant you the spell.
<li><tt>Ctrl-x</tt> Wizard's level 40 class power allows to uncurse an item.
<li><tt>r</tt>ead cursed scroll of repair to broke your cursed item, then read blessed scroll of repair to both repair and uncurse it. This
tactic can also be exploited to uncurse or bless large stacks of items.
</ul><p>

<b>Unequipping the item</b>
<ul>
<li>If your cursed item is a weapon, you can fight a monster with disarm ability. These are: ratling fencer/duelist/warrior/warlord,
(master) swordsman, bunny master (Bugs), Mad Minstrel.
<li>For helmets, Kranf Niest will remove any helmet from the PC as a part of getting the Healing skill.
</ul><p>

<b>Morphing</b><p>
<tt>!</tt> dipping items into a potion of raw chaos or blessed potion of exchange will change the item into another of its type,
removing it from your body. Keep in mind that if you are using raw chaos potions you have a risk of explosion, which does 10d30 damage
and corrupts heavily (100d100 CP's).<p>

<b>Destroying</b>
<ul>
<li>Scroll of item destruction works only if there are at least 4 items equipped, granting only 25% chance to lose your cursed item.
<li>Annihilators and eyes of destruction can destroy equipped items, regardless of material.
<li>Angering your deity (usually just by praying repeatedly) will eventually result it "Your equipment turns to dust." destroying all
cursed equipped items (remove other items).
<li>For iron items only, (large/giant) rust monsters are usable - just stand next to them.
<li>If your cursed item is a weapon made of iron, mithril or adamantium, attacking ochre jellies or gray oozes can damage it to the point of destruction.
Similarly, you can get rid of cursed gloves or boots by fighting these unarmed or kicking them, respectively.
<li>Acid or fireball trap can be set off <tt>Ctrl-t</tt> to intentionaly destroy equipped item, however only items destructible by acid or fire respectively -
see the item destruction table below. Bad Luck helps here. The table is useful for the remaining methods as well.
<li>For items destructible by fire, visit ToEF - however as this is dangerous for all items, bringing blessed fireproof blanket is recommended.
<li>Monsters with breath attacks can destroy equipped items.
</ul><p>

<a name="0ee"></a><h4>0.14.14 Item destruction</h4>
Item destruction has two parameters, the elemental type, and the maximum number of items to destroy.
There are 7 elements which can cause item destruction or damage (max number of items in parenthesis):
<ul>
<li>fire: ToEF (2 every turn), exploding spellbook (1000), failed Alchemy (Min(1,dmg/5)), fireball trap, fire vortex, red dragons
<li>ice: D:49, ice vortex, white dragons
<li>acid: acid trap (Min(1,dmg/5)), acid vortex, black dragons
<li>lightning: Air Temple (Min(1,dmg/5)), lightning vortex, blue dragons
<li>water: water trap (1000), pool (1000), rain (1), Swimming (50% chance, 1000 items), water orb insertion on D:48, water elementals/grues/dragons
<li>crushing: falling Rift (40), ceiling door trap (DL), pit traps, failed mountaineering (Min(1,dmg/5))
<li>ripping: exploding rune door trap
</ul><p>

Equipped rings of ice or fire have chance of negating equipment fire or ice damage,
respectively. The RingBonus is 98/80/50 B/U/C for each equipped ring. All damage is negated
if Min(99, RingBonus+Luck) &lt;= 1d100. Fireproof/waterproof blankets protect inventory (not equipment)
100% against fire/water damage respecively, regardless of B/U/C status. Fireproof blanket is destroyed if
5/15/100 B/U/C + (GoodLuck-BadLuck) * 10 &gt;=1d1000. Always the best blanket is selected if there are multiple.
Note that in this case BadLuck actually
increases fireproof blanket longevity (probably bug). Waterproof blankets are not destroyed in this manner.<p>

For fire, ice, acid and lightning elemental damage being resistant decreases chances of item damage.
The Divisor starts at 1; there is +2 if you are intrinsically resistant, +3 if you
are intrinsically immune, +1 per equipped item granting resistance, and +3 per equipped
item granting immunity. Note this is different from resistance to HP damage.<p>

Items which are not immune (0% in the below table) have a base chance of destruction or damage depending
only on the item's material and the element in question. This chance is reduced by 20% (rounding down) if
the item is blessed. It is then increased by 50% if the item is rusty and twice your Luck is subtracted.
Finally, the chance is divided by the Divisor above.<p>

Some other facts regarding item destruction:
<ul>
<li>If a stack of items is targeted, the number of actually damaged/destroyed items is 1dNumberOfItemsInStack.
<li>Any item/element combination value of 1% is completely safe if the item is blessed and the PC does not have negative Luck.
<li>Thick gauntlets automatically resist damage 75% of the time.
<li>Artifacts cannot be damaged.
<li>Any item grating resistance can't be damaged by the corresponding element. This is not true for items granting immunity.
<li>Always half of items in inventory are safe from damage. This changes as items are picked or dropped, or the inventory is viewed.
<li>Equipment items are considered for damage, starting from the bottom and working up; tools are the first to take a hit and the helmet is the last.
<li>Body armor cannot be damaged during wearing or removing.
<li>Rings under gauntlets can't be damaged; however gauntlets may get destroyed first leaving rings vulnerable.
<li>No items can be damaged during a long interruptible action, such as reading a book.
<li>Rustproofed and naturally rustproof items cannot be affected by water.
<li>The room effect "scarred by many fights" triples chance of item destruction.
<li>Items made of glass are 100% destroyed if kicked.

[3] Moderate-sized monsters will have a 10% chance to drop a big missile weapon (long bow or heavy crossbow) instead of a small one.
Smaller monsters will always drop a smaller weapon.<p>
