<a name="0c"></a><h3>Powers</h3>
Powers in ADOM are intrinsics, status conditions and item powers. Status conditions differ from intrinsics, as intrinsics are usually permanent unless/until they
are removed (by removing an item if granted by one; or by magical means such as pools or karma). Also, status conditions appear in the bottom left of the game screen;
whilst intrinsics can usually only be identified by a potion of insight or the Revelation spell. Item powers are magical properties of certain items, usually artifacts.<p>

<a name="0c1"></a><h4>0.12.1 Intrinsics</h4>
There is no command to view your intrinsics. You have to find a way to see them in game. The available methods are:
<ul>
<li>drink a potion of insight
<li>cast the Revelation spell
<li>intrinsics are revealed upon death
</ul><p>

<a name="0c11"></a><h4>0.12.1.1 Resistances</h4>
There are various resistances available. These are:
<ul>
<li>damage types: fire, cold, acid, shock
<li>special attacks: paralysis, petrification, poison, confusion, death rays,
 sleep, stun, sickness
</ul><p>

Remember that resistance does NOT equal immunity in ADOM, ie. being hit by a
death ray while resistant will not kill you instantly, but will still deal a
significant amount of damage.
Some of the resistances can be gained by eating an appropriate monster corpse:
Intrinsic fire resistance can be gained by eating the corpse of fire-related creatures.
The game generates messages related to this:
<ul>
<li>fire beetle (50% chance of gaining fire resistance):
You suddenly feel very hot! (whether or not resistance has actually been granted)
<li>fire lizard (10% chance of gaining fire resistance):
You suddenly shiver. (fire resistance granted)
This stuff cools you down! (fire resistance not granted)
<li>larger fire creatures, fire drakes, red dragons, and red wyrms, grants fire resistance
every time
</ul><p>

There are further considerations about fire resistance in the Tower of Eternal Flames.
See section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html">2.5</a> for more explanation.
<ul>
<li>cold resistance can be gained by eating white dragons or white wyrms corpses
<li>acid resistance can be gained by eating ankheg, ant, black dragon or black wyrm corpses
<li>shock resistance can be gained by eating lightning lizard, blue dragons or blue wyrms corpses
<li>poison resistance can be gained by eating giant centipede, cave fisher, tarantula, snake, viper,
spider, or dark elven corpses. Be aware that most of this both poisons the PC and grants
resistance, so the PC will have to endure a brief period of poisoning
<li>petrification resistance can be gained by eating gorgon corpse (but the PC should have it already
by other means, else is risking death)
</ul><p>

An interesting test conducted by Petri Sihvola regarding petrification by a gorgon's breath:
<pre>
> I did some testing and there's an approximate 50% chance of dying
> to a gorgon breath without resistance. However, if DV is high enough
> the chance is drastically reduced. This one shows my DV and how many
> times I died:

> DV:23 10/20
> DV:44 8/20
> DV:53 1/20
> DV:69 0/20
</pre>

[1] Final sickness attack deals 6d6 damage. It can be prevented with resistance, or (Wi*3.45)% chance or (Healing/5)% chance.<p>

<a name="0c12"></a><h4>0.12.1.2 Immunities</h4>
Immunity to the four basic damage types is possible: fire, cold, acid and shock.
Immunity means that the PC will take no damage from the corresponding elemental
attack. However, creatures which deal elemental damage can still harm the PC, due
to their ability to deal physical damage. The PC is only immune to damage from
the elemental attack.<p>

Obtaining immunities:
<ul>
<li>crowning
<ul>
<li>grants an immunity to one of fire, cold, acid or shock
</ul>

<li>wearables
<ul>
<li>dragon scale mail grants immunity to the corresponding element
<ul>
<li>red - fire
<li>white - cold
<li>blue - shock
<li>black - acid
</ul>
<li>crowns grants immunity to the corresponding element - fire, ice, lightning = shock
<li>the Crown of Science grants immunity to fire
<li>a moloch armor grants immunity to fire
<li>the Shield of Raw Steel grants immunity to fire and cold
<li>the Ancient Mummy Wrapping grants immunity to cold
<li>the armor "Nature's Companion" grants immunity to fire and shock
<li>the girdle "Celestrix" grants immunity to shock
<li>a ring of elemental mastery grants immunity to fire, cold and shock
<li>the Ring of Immunity grants all four immunities
</ul>

<li>wielded weapons
<ul>
<li>the mighty morning star "Grod" grants immunity to fire
<li>the Scorched Spear grants immunity to cold
<li>the Rune-covered Trident grants immunity to cold
<li>the Hammer of the Gods grants immunity to shock
<li>the Staff of the Wanderer grants immunity to shock
<li>the Spear of Raw Steel grants immunity to acid (if it exists)
<li>the Trident of the Red Rooster grants all four immunities
</ul>

<li>corpses
<ul>
<li>eating a giant slug corpse grants immunity to acid
<li>eating a <i>blessed</i> lightning lizard corpse has a 12.5% chance of granting shock immunity
<li>eating Srraxxarrakex's corpse grants immunity to shock
</ul>

<li>class powers
<ul>
<li>Assassins receive immunity to poison at level 40
<li>Druids receive shock immunity at level 40
<li>Weaponsmiths receive fire immunity at level 32
</ul>
</ul><p>

<a name="0c13"></a><h4>0.12.1.3 Dooming and Cursing</h4>
Basically, Cursed and Doomed intrinsics decrease PC's Luck, which is a
hidden property. See section <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#064">0.6.4</a> for
details.<p>

Dooming or Cursing, as might be expected from the names, is generally
to be avoided. They result from robbing shops, by drinking from pools, 
attacking karmic creatures in melee, reading scrolls of ill fate, cursing 
monster attacks (green hag, annis hag, black wizard, black druid), 
or eating certain corpses:
<ul>
<li>Cursing only: ancient dwarf, annis hag, green hag, quasit                                
<li>Dooming only: least/lesser/greater daemon, Cat Lord
<li>both: Cute Dog, dwarven child, Oracle, Priest, royal guardian, (greater) white unicorn
</ul><p>

Cursing makes the game nudge all the die-rolls against the PC, generate
more monsters which hit harder while the PC's hits become weaker.
Dooming is a more severe form of this. Dooming also increases background corruption rate, 
and makes it much more difficult to pray for divine help.<p>

Nevertheless, there are ways to exploit these intrinsics. These
techniques are not for the beginner, of course. Vaults and wilderness encounters
become more common. If the PC wants to achieve Grand Mastery in a weapon
class, becoming Cursed and/or Doomed in the wilderness is the only way to
do it in a reasonable time frame.<p>

Dooming and cursing can be removed by sacrificing at a coaligned altar.
It may take considerable sacrificing to remove the Cursed/Doomed
intrinsics, since they are only removed at the "very close" level of
piety. Praying while the PC is already at very close status also may
remove dooming and/or cursing, although these intrinsics make it more
difficult to appeal for divine assistance, as noted above. Removing Dooming
(only) results in the message "You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from
you." Removing Cursing (only) results in the message "You feel relieved."
Removing both Cursing and Dooming simultaneously results in only the "You
feel a terrible gloom being lifted from you." message.<p>

Another trick for exploiting the Doomed state is as follows: If a PC finds
an altar early in the game, ideally before the Si level so that zero or
very few artifacts have been generated, the PC should purchase or acquire
plenty of food (cooked lizards and/or stomafillia herbs), become Doomed by
eating a dooming corpse (daemons and quasits spring to mind) or wearing a
ring of doom, and then exploit the heavy monster generation by sacrificing
the monsters on the altar. This can quickly lead to very close or even
extremely close status. After the Dooming is removed, by removing a cursed
ring of doom or through reaching very close status, the PC can be crowned
or precrowned.<p>

Dooming also has an effect in dark rooms: if a Doomed PC wanders into
a dark room, there is 2% chance for an instakill "You are likely to be eaten by a grue." 
(this only applies to Doomed characters). Deliberately playing in a Cursed or Doomed state is dangerous
and should be reserved for those players who know exactly why they are doing it.<p>

There is a game bug that causes fireproof blankets to be positively affected by
the Cursed and Doomed intrinsics. It makes them last almost forever in the ToEF.
It is probably not worth the cursing or dooming to make the blanket last. The
ToEF is usually difficult enough in a Blessed state. 
<small>The bug is fixed in v1.2.0.</small><p>

The following items grant Cursing/Dooming intrinsics:
<ul>
<li>Cursing only: Black Torc, Executor
<li>Dooming only: armor/weapon/missile of damnation, javelin of doom, Celestrix
<li>both: ring of doom, Crown of Science, Crown of Chaos, Medal of Chaos, Sceptre of Chaos, Boots of Great Speed   
</ul><p>

<a name="0c14"></a><h4>0.12.1.4 Lucky and Fate smiles</h4>
Basically, Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics increases PC's Luck, which is a
hidden property. See section <a href="adomgb-0-6.html#064">0.6.4</a> for
details.<p>

The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are the good counterparts to the
Cursing and Dooming intrinsics, respectively. They cause the game to
nudge die-rolls in the PC's favor. The effect is not as dramatic as
the Dooming and Cursing intrinsics - Fate smiles almost counters Cursing. 
It should be noted that all four intrinsics may be present simultaneously. 
The negative ones are considerably stronger.<p>

The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are naturally gained by PCs as
they sacrifice on coaligned altars; the messages are:<p>

"You feel an inner strength lifting your spirits!" - The Lucky intrinsic<br>
"You feel very close to -deity-." - The Fate smiles intrinsic<p>

Eating karmic corpses increases Luck, by losing Dooming, Cursing, or gaining
Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics. Scrolls of luck work similarly but have no 
effect on Dooming.<p>

The following items grant Lucky/Fate smiles intrinsics:
<ul>
<li>Lucky only: amulet/ring of luck, Preserver, Bracers of War, Purifier
<li>Fate smiles only: Ring of the Master Cat
<li>both: Ankh, True Strength
</ul><p>

<a name="0c15"></a><h4>0.12.1.5 Teleportitis and Teleport Control</h4>
Teleportitis is a "disease" that causes your PC to teleport around randomly.
It is obtainable from pools (you feel jumpy), corruption (your close
attunement to corrupted astral space allows teleportation), from eating
the right corpse (pixie) and items (helm of teleportation, cloak of Oman).
It can be useful for escaping tight spots such as being surrounded by monsters
(though it never seems to kick in when needed ;), for shoplifting and for
reaching areas that are usually inaccessible.<p>

Teleport Control allows you to choose the destination when teleporting your PC.
It works whether the cause of the teleportation is teleportitis or deliberate,
such as <tt>z</tt>apping a wand of teleportation or casting the Teleport spell at the PC's
current location. Mindcrafters always get teleport control at experience level
one, others have to rely on eating the right corpse (blink dog), drinking from
pools (you feel like jumping around) or wearing items (amulet/ring of teleport
control, boots of the Divine Messenger).<p>

Controlled teleportation is important in the game. There is a guaranteed wand of
teleportation in the VDDL level of the Assassin's Guild. It can be found using
any of the item detection techniques. The wand and potions of booze are then
on-demand teleportation. Teleport control is not guaranteed but if necessary,
the PC can stair hop in the Infinite Dungeon between I3 and I4 until blink
dogs are generated.<p>

The following locations disallow teleportation of any source:
<ul>
<li>Any elemental temple. This does not include the lower levels of the Tower of Eternal Flames.
<li>The last level of the Tomb of the High Kings - the actual tomb containing the piranha lake and RotHK. (<a href="adomgb-2-12.html">2.12</a>)
<li>BUGCAV - the underground level of the Bug Temple. (<a href="adomgb-2-3.html">2.3</a>)
<li>The Cat Lord level. (<a href="adomgb-3-16.html">3.16</a>)
<li>The final level of the Assassins Guild. (<a href="adomgb-2-11.html#2b3">2.11.3</a>)
<li>D:49. (<a href="adomgb-3-23.html">3.23</a>)
</ul><p>

<a name="0c16"></a><h4>0.12.1.6 Invisibility and See Invisible</h4>
Invisibility provides several bonuses to Stealth, Backstabbing, to hit/damage etc.
Be aware however that invisible PCs are not allowed to fight in the Arena. Invisibility
can be gained by drinking from pools (you suddenly are gone), eating
invisible stalker corpse (10% chance), or wearing items, such as ring/robe/cloak
of invisibility, or Brannalbin's Cloak of Defence. Being invisible by wearing items
severely increases food consumption, see section
<a href="adomgb-0-3.html#032">0.3.2</a> for details. Potions of invisibility/visibility
and the Invisibility spell provide temporary effect.<p>

The See Invisible intrinsic can be gained by drinking from pools (your eyes tingle), eating
invisible stalker corpse (90% chance), wearing a ring of see invisible, Amulet of Raw
Steel, Medal of Chaos, Ring of the Master Cat, Crown of Leadership, Ancient Mummy
Wrapping, Shirt of The Saints, or wielding Rune-covered Trident or Trident of The Red
Rooster.<p>

<a name="0c17"></a><h4>0.12.1.7 Water breathing</h4>
It is possible to gain the water breathing intrinsic by eating
Blup's or Shyssiryxius' corpse. The message "For some seconds
a strange liquid seems to fill your lungs." is generated.<p>

Elementalists receive water breathing as an intrinsic class power
at experience level 25. Certain items and wielded weapons grant
the intrinsic:
<ul>
<li>helm/amulet of water breathing
<li>the rune-covered trident - when wielded
<li>the Trident of the Red Rooster - when wielded
<li>the Medal of Chaos - when worn
</ul><p>

The following items also stop drowning, although water breathing is not listed
as an intrinsic at the time.
<ul>
<li>rings of the fish - AUTOCURSING; 1 blessed or 2 of any status stop drowning
damage, single uncursed ring stops drowning 80%, cursed 60% of the time - if the PC is not cursed or doomed
<li>armor of the sea - stops drowning 100%, 80%, 60% of the time (blessed, uncursed,cursed)
</ul><p>

<a name="0c2"></a><h4>0.12.2 Status conditions</h4>
Status conditions are effects caused by certain actions in the game that temporarily influence characteristics of the PC (or a monster, if cast on one by certain means).
Such characteristics include loss of HP, loss of certain attributes, inability to use certain commands or even complete loss of mobility for a certain amount of turns.
Some may even be fatal. Status conditions are almost always negative; though a few can actually have positive effects.<p>

<a name="0c3"></a><h4>0.12.3 Item powers</h4>
For the effects of "Essence of Chaos and Corruption" power, see section <a href="adomgb-0-10.html#0a24">0.10.2.4</a>.<p>

<a name="0c31"></a><h4>0.12.3.1 Regeneration</h4>
Regeneration is a special item power which generates one additional hit point per turn. It works in addition to natural
regeneration described in section <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0e6">0.14.6</a>. The effects are cumulative, so if the PC
has two sourcers of Regeneration, it gains additional 2 HP per turn. The following items grant Regeneration: crown/ring/bracers of regeneration,
knife of endurance, Bracers of War, Preserver, True Strength, and Celestrix.
It is possible to regenerate a maximum of 9 HP per turn via Regeneration (head, amulet, girdle, hands, rings, bracers, missile).<p>

<a name="0c32"></a><h4>0.12.3.2 Critical hits</h4>
Critical hits is a special item power which allows the PC to score critical hits more often.
If a Critical hit is scored, the attack message generated includes "with full force" phrase. In case of missile attack,
the message includes "exactly hit" phrase. As critical hits do not bypass PV, it is possible to receive the "You hit the
-monster- with full force and fail to hurt it." message. In such a case even the double amount of damage wasn't enough
to get past the PV. Consider switching the form of offense.
The following items grant Critical hits:
orcish dagger, whip of slaughtering, murderous weapon, Bracers of War, Ring of the Master Cat, Grod, Serpent's Bite, Axe of the Minotaur
Emperor, and Spear of Raw Steel. Refer to section <a href="adomgb-0-7.html#077">0.7.7</a> for more quantitative details.<p>

<a name="0c33"></a><h4>0.12.3.3 Autocursing</h4>
Autocursing items become cursed when equipped. It is obviously a bad effect, though not terrible for moderately advanced PC, since the curse can be removed via
regular means, which include dipping the item into potion of holy water, reading a scroll of uncursing, casting the Remove Curse spell, praying, or using
Wizard's 40th level
class power. The following mostly bad items share the AUTOCURSING property: amulet of hunger, ring of doom, ring of the fish, ring of weakness, gauntlets of peace,
boots of the slow shuffle, auto-locking armor, Black Torc, Medal of Chaos, Crown of Science, Shezestriakis, Moon Sickle, and Kinslayer.<p>

<a name="0c34"></a><h4>0.12.3.4 Slaying</h4>
Many artifact and few special regular weapons are imbued with Slaying powers. This means the particular weapon always scores a critical hit against certain monster types.
Vanquisher is very valued artifact weapon since it slays almost everything. A missile of slaying (without specification) slays everything. Refer to section
<a href="adomgb-0-9.html#094">0.9.4</a> to determine monster types.<p>

<a name="0c341"></a><table border="1"><caption>Slaying weapons</caption>
<tr><th>Monster type<th>Weapons
<tr><td>Battle bunnies <td>rabbit knife
<tr><td>Constructs <td>Vanquisher, Purifier, arrow/quarrel of construct slaying
<tr><td>Demons <td>Vanquisher, Grod, Rune-covered Trident, Purifier, Executor, Trident of the Red Rooster, Justifier, arrow/quarrel/sling bullet of demon slaying
<tr><td>Dragons <td>Vanquisher, Wyrmlance, arrow/quarrel of dragon slaying
<tr><td>Giants <td>Vanquisher, Grod, arrow/quarrel of giant slaying
<tr><td>Humanoids <td>Vanquisher, Serpent's Bite, Skullcrusher, Executor, Kinslayer, arrow/quarrel of humanoid slaying
<tr><td>Insects <td>Bugbiter
<tr><td>Jellies <td>Vanquisher, Soaker, arrow/quarrel of jelly slaying
<tr><td>Plants <td>Scorched Spear, Black Thumb
<tr><td>Rats <td>Cat's Claw
<tr><td>Undead <td>mace of disruption, Vanquisher, Rune-covered Trident, Purifier, Trident of the Red Rooster, Justifier, Sun's Messenger, Black Torc, arrow/quarrel of undead slaying
</table><p>

<a name="0c35"></a><h4>0.12.3.5 Returning</h4>
Some missiles or weapons possess a special Returning power, which means the missile or weapon returns when thrown. This does not mean the PC catches it automatically -
the actual chance of successfully catching a returning missile depends on Dexterity and Luck. The following missiles and artifacts share the Returning power:
dagger/spear/drakish scurgar of returning, curved throwing club, javelin of doom, boomerang, Black Torc, Rolf's Companion, Rune-covered Trident,
Trident of the Red Rooster, Hammer of the Gods, and Spear of Raw Steel.<p>

<a name="0c36"></a><h4>0.12.3.6 Penetration</h4>
Penetration is the act of bypassing the PV of a creature in combat, dealing damage as if the creature has PV of 0. For PC, penetration can only be achieved via a phase dagger,
a penetrating weapon, a missile of penetration, or via Archer's 40th level class power, which grants 20% chance of bypassing enemy armor when using missile.
On the other hand, several monsters, such as ratling duelists and claw bugs, will always bypass the PV of the PC.<p>

<a name="0c37"></a><h4>0.12.3.7 Item statuses</h4>
The following statuses modify the item's function or stats in some way. More than one status can be present at the same time.
<ul>
<li><b>Rusty</b> - iron items become rusty by exposure to water - swimming, water traps, rain, water breath attacks. Water traps and rain can be prevented 
by wearing a hooded cloak. Other common cause to rusting is (large/giant) rust monster. Dipping iron items into a potion of water or cursed oil of rust removal also 
results in rusty status. Rusty weapons deal half damage and are more prone to breaking. Rusty armor reduces Appearance by 1 and is more prone to destruction. 
Rusty tools are more liable to breaking when used. Rusty wands usually function normally. Rust is removed by dipping the item into a non-cursed oil of rust removal, or via Smithing/Glod.

<li><b>Broken</b> - weapons, keys and wands may become broken simply by frequent usage. Blessed items are less prone to breaking, cursed more. Cursed scrolls of repair break items, 
even the non-breakable ones (such as herbs; broken potions still can be quaffed with usual effect, broken scrolls and books can be read etc.). Broken weapons deal only half damage 
(cumulative with rust). Broken wands and keys are non-functional. Broken status of metal items (except gold, since there are no gold ingots) 
can be removed by Smithing. Non-cursed scroll of repair or Glod will remove broken status from any item or items stack.

<li><b>Rustproof</b> - invulnerable to water and rust. Metal items can be made rustproof by dipping them into a blessed oil of rust removal, or a (cursed) potion of oil. 
Few items are naturally rustproof - lead sling bullet, ring of the fish, amulet/helm of water breathing, and iron ore.

<li><b>Waterproof</b> - functionally identical to rustproof, but for non-metal items. Rust monsters ignore non-iron items. 
Waterproof items are created by dipping non-metal items into a potion of oil (may fail, cursed works best) or a blessed oil of rust removal. It makes sense only for 
scrolls and books, since other materials aren't damaged by water. 

<li><b>Poisoned</b> - weapons, missiles and food items can be made poisoned by diping them into a potion of poison (any status). Weapons and missiles are denoted by (p) 
after the stats, instead of saying "poisoned", like for food items. Poisoned status wears off after few hits from poisoned weapons. Poisoned food can be used as
a missile to poison monsters. The status always dissappears from missiles and food after they are fired, regardless of whether they hit or not.  

<li><b>Cooked</b> - corpses improved by the Cooking skill, or Fire Bolt, Fireball or Improved Fireball spells. Also monster's fire breath can create cooked corpses. 
Their nutrition value is doubled, weight decreased by 5%, and rotting is 4x slower.

<li><b>Lit</b> - torches. You need to have both tinderbox and box with flint and steel with charges left to make a torch lit. A lit torch negates darkness, increases 
visibility radius by 3 squares, and disables Stealth. A lit torch can't be in the backpack, however you can lit 3 torches at the same time - in both hands and in the tool slot.       
</ul><p>

Artifacts are mostly excluded from these statuses, except they can be poisoned by dipping them into a potion of poison and broken with a cursed scroll of repair. 
<small>Fixed in v1.2.0.</small><p>
