<a name="0f"></a><h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<a name="0f1"></a><h4>0.15.1 Dungeon generation</h4>
Thanks to gut for the following observations.<p>

Dungeon generation has a few peculiarities that may be worth mentioning.
Almost all rooms generated on any level will have an odd number of floor
spaces available. To my knowledge, the only exception to this is the very
rare random shop room. They are capable of being generated with an even
number of available floor spaces, and this causes the 'dig' algorithm in the
game to be unable to connect them to the rest of the map. The only way
to reach these shops is by tunneling.<p>

Remarks about staircase generation and room layout:<p>

When hopping in the ID, I noticed that some rooms were likely to have staircases in the adjacent
room. Basically, if you enter a room that's <i>in</i> a corner, or <i>near</i> a corner, and your
room has a door that leads <i>directly</i> up, down, left or right, into a corner, there is
likely a stair room there.<p>

For example, if a room like this:<p>
<pre>
   #########
   #.......#
   #.<.....#
   #.......#
   #####.###
       #+#
</pre>
is generated at the top of the level, at the left or right-hand corners, it
likely leads to a stair room.<p>

Please note that this:<p>
<pre>
   #########
   #.......#
   #.<.....###
   #.........#
   #########.#
           #.#
           #.#
           ..#
</pre>
isn't the same, and will not work.<p>

One like this:<p>
<pre>
      #+#
   ####.####
   #.......#
   #.<.....#
   #.......#
   #########
</pre>
at the bottom left or right-hand corners is good too.<p>

A room like this:<p>
<pre>

 #######
 #.....##
 #.<....+
 #.....##
 #######
</pre>
has a high probability if it is generated at the right-hand side of the map,
but it has to be at the very top or bottom, right next to a corner.<p>

The same goes for a room like this:<p>
<pre>
 #######
##.....#
+....<.#
##.....#
 #######
</pre>
in the left hand side of the level.<p>

A room like this :<p>
<pre>
 #######
##.....###
.....<....
##.....###
 #######
</pre>
is also good if next to any corner, but doesn't seem as sure as the others.<p>

<a name="0f2"></a><h4>0.15.2 Kicking <tt>k</tt></h4>
You ought to know that you can <tt>k</tt>ick various things around. Pressing <tt>K</tt> will reveal your kick damage.<p>
<b>General</b><p>
KickBonus is normally 0. Strong Legs talent gives +15, Monks get +Level*2.
Kicking is not possible while in a pit or webs or the wilderness.
Kicking while confused, stunned, or blind requires a
Attribute in attribute+40 check; attribute is Dexterity for blindness and Willpower for Confused
and Stunned state.<p>

<b>Doors <tt>+</tt></b><p>
Kicking a door will succeed St + KickBonus times in St + 12 (112 if the door is secret). Successfully kicking doors will
cause tension rooms to crumble, will always trigger traps, and trains St. There is a 20% chance that 1d2 sticks will
be created. Unsuccessfully kicking a door has a 14-St chance in 15 of training St. If the door is trapped,
you have a (Ma + 1) in 30 chance of NOT triggering it. If you avoid the trap, you will train Mana. Failing to kick open
an undiscovered secret door is treated as kicking an undiggable wall. If a secret door is kicked open and discovered at the same
instant, it has a 10% chance of being trapped.<p>

<b>Walls <tt>#</tt></b><p>
Level 13+ Monks can kick down walls on a straight Strength in 100 roll. Non-Monks kicking walls will take 1dN damage,
N = Max(2, St/3). Add 2 to N if the wall is non-diggable.<p>

<a name="0f3"></a><h4>0.15.3 Undocumented character abilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>All characters gain to-hit and to-damage bonuses when fighting as a true
berserker, which means no armor can be worn and Tactics must be set to
berserk. Shields are acceptable, any worn armor is not. Level 40 and
higher Barbarians get additional bonuses on top of this when fighting as
a true berserker. Note that Monks do not seem to receive this true berserker bonus.
<li>Monks gain the ability to kick down walls at experience level 13.
<li>Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings, scrolls,
or wands. This specialization allows them to identify any item in that
category on sight.
<li>Merchants get additional bonuses to throwing coins (+level to hit,
+level/2+3 to damage). Dopplegangers cannot deflect a merchant's thrown coins.
The coin throw action costs 1200 energy points as opposed to the normal 1000. Getting the
Quick Shot talent does apply to the coin throw attack, bringing it to 1080. The coin throw
attack is not capable of receiving weapon marks, nor does it benefit from the Strong Thrower
talent. The Archery skill is not trained by coin throwing. Coin throwing does benefit from
a high Dexterity attribute, rings of slaying, archery gloves, the Good Shot talent, the Keen Shot
talent, the Quick Shot talent, the Missile Weapon Master talent, and the Find Weakness skill.
Coin throw attacks start out with a range of only 3, but at exp. level 10, it increases to 5,
and increases a further +2 with each 10 experience levels gained.
<li>Healers have the ability to use a stethoscope without consuming any game
time. All other classes consume one turn of game time when using a
stethoscope.
<li>Archers have a unique ability to dodge missiles. When a missile misses any other
class PC, it simply stops at the PC's square. Missiles often fly past Archers. This is
actually probably undesirable since Archers want to pick up those missiles, but it is
nevertheless an undocumented unique ability.
</ul><p>

<a name="0f4"></a><h4>0.15.4 Smithing</h4>
Taken from <a href="http://www.adomgb.info/adomfaq.html">Official ADOM FAQ</a>:<p>

Smithing is a complicated task. You need the following ingredients:
<ol>
<li>Any kind of hammer <tt>(</tt>.
<li>An anvil <tt>]</tt>. There are two guaranteed in the game (kill Kherab and Glod), but
they also rarely appear in dungeons.
<li>Something to smith! You need to know what kind of metal it's made of (use Metallurgy).
<li>An ingot of the appropriate metal <tt>]</tt>. A lump of ore won't cut it, but can be converted
into ingots by applying the Smithing skill to it first. Generate some lumps by Mining.
<li>A forge <tt>&</tt>. You can't carry these around with you, but you can hope to find one in your
travels. There are two locations in the game where forges are guaranteed (Dwarftown and
Darkforge), and there can be additional forges at random locations.
</ol>
Stand on the forge, wield the hammer, and <tt>a</tt>pply your Smithing skill to your metal item.
This will also serve to make metal ingots out of ore lumps. It's rumored that wearing
a leather apron helps in some mysterious way.<p>

Other useful facts regarding Smithing:
<ul>
<li>An easy way to train Smithing is by removing rust. Low risk of damaging the item, no lost ingots,
and easy to get rusty items with a river or a water trap. Also quite fast.
<li>Glod charges exactly 2500gp in all cases, and only if he is on the current level, for the use of his forge.
Killing him, luring him off the level, and turning him into a writhing mass of primal chaos will all stop the demands; making him hostile won't.
<li>The Smithing skill costs a base 5000gp from Glod, 5250 if female. If you have very high Charisma, you get a discount; 1% per 1 Ch over 15.
Being cursed doubles the price, doomed triple, being Troll doubles, being Orc quadruples, all cumulative.
<li>You need a hammer wielded in either hand and an anvil in inventory and equipment to smith. If multiple such items apply, the best by B/U/C is used.
The following items count as hammers: large eternium hammer, large mithril hammer, large adamantium hammer, huge iron hammer, eternium warhammer, warhammer,
adamantium warhammer, mithril warhammer, hammer of the gods, large hammer.
<li>You can do three things with a smithing setup - smelt ore, remove rust, and improve items.
<li>Teleportitis does not occur during smithing sessions.
<li>Smithing is influenced by the statuses of all involved items (hammer, anvil, worked item, and ingot if applicable). BUCMod in the below formulas means
+10 per cursed item and -10 per blessed item.
<li>You can never smith artifacts.
</ul><p>

<a name="0f41"></a><h4>0.15.4.1 Smelting ore</h4>
<ul>
<li>Takes 25 turns (even for Weaponsmiths). If you are interrupted, the ore is lost.
<li>Let Difficulty = BUCMod + 0/-5/-10/-20 by ore material (iron/mithril/adamantium/eternium - better materials are easier).
<li>If Smithing >= 1d(110+Difficulty), you now have an ingot (10/80/10 B/U/C and 2% chance of rusty if iron) instead of the ore.
<li>Otherwise, you fail. Normally you keep the ore. There is a Difficulty+1 in Smithing*4 chance of losing the ore.
</ul><p>

<a name="0f42"></a><h4>0.15.4.2 Removing rust</h4>
<ul>
<li>Takes 25 turns, or 6 for level 12+ Weaponsmiths. Being interrupted has no lasting effects.
<li>If Smithing >= 1d(110+BUCMod), you remove the rust.
<li>Otherwise, nothing happens. There is a BUCMod+1 in Smithing*4 chance of the item becoming broken.
</ul><p>

<a name="0f43"></a><h4>0.15.4.3 Improving items</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires an ingot of the same material as the work item, which is consumed in the process.
<li>Requires (200 - Smithing) turns (one-quarter that for level 12+ Weaponsmiths). Being interrupted has no lasting effects and does not consume an ingot.
<li>If the item is broken, you will attempt to fix it. Succeed if 120 + BUCMod &lt; Smithing. No penalty on failure.
<li>Otherwise, you attempt to increase the item's stats. This is a two-step process; first you must pass a Smithing check to improve the item at all,
then the amount by which the item is improved is determined. Improvement amounts are determined only by the item's existing stats, not by skill.
If you fail the Smithing check, "You fail to improve the -item-". If you pass it but zero improvement is rolled, "Despite your best efforts the quality
of the -item- does not improve.". Otherwise, "You manage to improve the -item-.".
<li>The difficulty of the check is determined as follows:
<ul>
<li>Start with Difficulty equal to BUCMod.
<li>If the item is a weapon, add 12 times the sum of the absolute values of the to-hit and to-damage numbers (X and Y in (+X, 1d4+Y)).
<li>Otherwise, add 18 times the sum of the absolute values of the DV and PV numbers.
<li>If you are a Weaponsmith of any level and Difficulty is positive, divide it by 2. Otherwise, add 20.
<li>Subtract your experience level.
<li>Final Difficulty is 120 + Difficulty, with a minimum of 120.
</ul>
<li>Supposing you pass the test (Smithing >= 1dDifficulty), the amounts and types of increase depend on the item's class.
<li>For melee and missile weapons:
<ul>
<li>Increase to-hit by 1d4 if to-hit is less than 9 and one chance in the (absolute value of to-hit or 2, whichever is larger).
<li>Increase to-damage by 1d4 if to-damage is less than 9 and one chance in the (absolute value of to-damage or 2, whichever is larger), and to-hit was not increased.
<li>For melee weapons only, increase the DV modifier by 1 if it is no more than 3 more than the base DV modifier of the weapon type, and neither to-hit nor to-damage were increased.
</ul>
<li>For helmets, armor, girdles, shields, bracers, gauntlets, and boots:
<ul>
<li>Increase DV by 1d3 if it is less than 6 more than the base value OR on a one-in-(3 + 2*abs(DV)) chance.
<li>Increase PV by 1d3 if it is less than 4 more than the base value OR on a one-in-(3 + 2*abs(PV)) chance, and DV was not increased.
</ul>
<li>All other item types cannot be improved.
</ul><p>

<a name="0f5"></a><h4>0.15.5 Darkness</h4>
Creating darkness:
<ul>
<li>Darkness spell
<li>crystal of darkness
<li>scroll of darkness
</ul><p>

Removing darkness:
<ul>
<li>Light spell
<li>wand of light
<li>crystal of light
<li>scroll of light (note that while it is impossible to read a scroll while in darkness, you can read a scroll of light while standing next to a dark area)
<li>the artifact potion Phial of Caladriel
<li>torch - temporary
<li>prayer
</ul><p>

Thanks to gut for the following section.<p>

Darkness is one of the most useful options available to all literate PCs, yet it's one of the most
underused. I can't count the number of players that say that they never even bothered with trying it.<p>

Monsters that can't see in Darkness will allow the PC to pound them to death without retaliation. The
only exception is for monsters that are capable of panic. These monsters will be able to hit the PC when
in a state of panic, but <i>only</i> if they do not have an escape route. For this reason, it's best to
avoid using Darkness in a narrow corridor, because stray monsters can easily cut off the escape path of
a powerful monster that is capable of killing the PC with one hit.<p>

No giant can see in Darkness, most humanoids also can't, with the notable exceptions of trolls, orcs,
minotaurs, and dark elves. This is especially important to remember against tough monsters such as ogre
magi (yes even the arena champion kind). Vortices, mimics and several other early-game PC killers are
all helpless in Darkness and vortices aren't even capable of panic.<p>

There is a bug in the game that keeps Darkness from working properly on door squares. It is important
to mention that the PC is perfectly safe to use Darkness if the <i>PC</i> is on the door square, but not
if the monster is on the door square.<p>

Other monsters that are known to see in Darkness (thanks mike):<p>

All orcs, all dark elves, all minotaurs, all undead, all red dragons, great blue wyrm, stone golem,
stone grue, stone snake, earth elemental, greater earth elemental, living wall, wall beast, diamond golem,
eternium golem, steel golem, steel horror, carrion crawler, chaos brother, WMoPC, master assassin, fire demon,
quickling king, quickling queen, greater claw bug, killer bug, least daemon, lesser daemon, greater daemon,
jackal demon, black unicorn.<p>

<a name="0f7"></a><h4>0.15.7 Bugs</h4>
The list is by no means complete. Very minor bugs and typos are not listed.<p>

<a name="0f71"></a><h4>0.15.7.1 Bugs causing the game to crash</h4>
<ul>
<li>taking the Skilled talent on character creation
<li>dipping gold into potion of exchange
<li>giving out poisoned meat
<li>dipping fluff ball into water, when there is no room for the gremlins
<li>reading a scroll of repair without any other items whatsoever
<li>reading a scroll of item destruction if your inventory is only four or more stacks of other scrolls of item destruction
<li>extended drop with wrong identified state (happens most often with ingots)
<li>occasionally, saved Khelavaster dropping spellbooks
<li>occasionally, chatting to an unique scared by the unholy aura corruption (proven with Thrundarr)
<li>companion or slave berserking itself
<li>generating and using negative heaps of gold created via dragon gold doubling
<li>some uniques (Gaab'Baay for sure) stepping on a trap
<li>Mindcrafter killing corrupting monsters that stand behind other monsters with Mindcraft
<li>GetTargetData (-2) - this can happen randomly; however very rare
</ul><p>

<a name="0f72"></a><h4>0.15.7.2 Bugs causing unfair death</h4>
<ul>
<li>monster equipping moloch armor - the energy of doing so should be 37600, but wraps around to -27936, giving the monster 28 free turns
<li>kicking walls with St&lt;3 can cause extraordinary damage (another wrap)
<li>death on a Monday from low HP
<li>moving huge amounts of gold into missile slot can result in death if wearing girdle of greed - the girdle takes into account only gold carried in inventory
</ul><p>

<a name="0f73"></a><h4>0.15.7.3 Bugs used to get unfair advantage</h4>
Taking advantage of (or abusing) bugs in this category is generally frowned upon.
At least, you should mention which bugs you took advantage of when posting YAVP.<p>
<ul>
<li>naming the unseen - the <tt>n</tt>ame command can be used to detect invisible monsters, even without the See Invisible intrinsic
<li>piety overflow - pissing a god too much causes the piety to wrap around to very high positive value, allowing for many crownings
<li>dragons can pick up gold which is then effectively doubled when they are killed; see <a href="adomgb-0-9.html#0944">0.9.4.4</a>
<li>the Monk's circular kick ability, as well as Fighter's all round attack, have issues when non-hostiles are near; it will ask
if you're sure you want to kick or attack them, and you select no - your kick/attack still hits the other monsters, but no time passes
<li>using fast pickup command <tt>;</tt> while standing on a pile of items, then canceling it (<tt>q</tt>),
causes the number of elapsed game turns to decrease; this can be used to get ludicrous bonus to high score
<li>starting to walk against a wall wastes one turn without the PC moving; this can be abused to get free HP and PP regeneration without monsters being allowed to act
<li>the Good Learner talent grants 40% more xp, instead of the stated 2%
<li>kick robbing - items can be kicked out of shop if a corner wall is destroyed - the game doesn't consider this technique robbing at all
<li>Casino gambling happens in one turn, the PC doesn't get the corruption it should; and winnings are virtually guaranteed
<li>blessing undead while invisible will not make them aware of your presence, and you can kill them without them fighting back; works also with bolt spells and Drakeling's acid spit;
same for monsters who don't see in darkness; unless panicked, they just stay in place and take damage
<li>attribute training from herbs/corpses/Garth is based on modified attributes instead of base attributes; this leads to abuse of sickness and starvation to pump attributes unrealistically high
<li>Necromancers lvl50 using +To equipment can return to life indefinitely
<li>look command detects webs outside visibility if level has been explored before
<li>wish engines - a way to get unlimited wishes
<ol>
<li>gather a stack of 19 rings, and a handful of potions of exchange
<li>bless the potions and dip the rings into them at DL 8 to have best chance for generating rings of djinni summoning; since 19 rings can be dipped at once, a lucky PC can end up with
19 wishes from this alone
<li>the probability of getting a ring of djinni summoning is about 5%; if you wish for potions of exchange, you get an average of 3, so converting all wishes into potions (minus a few water)
gives ~57 PoEX; the odds of being able to get more RoDS is pretty high at this point
</ol>
</ul><p>

<a name="0f74"></a><h4>0.15.7.4 Other bugs</h4>
<ul>
<li>berserking - monster can sometimes panic and attack themselves
<li>half of the artifacts are only available as crowning gifts, and can never be generated randomly
<li>the rate of corruption increases at the 90-day mark, but doesn't again at the 180 and 270 day marks as it's supposed to
<li>Unicorn birthsign increases how quickly alignment changes towards chaotic instead of decreasing it
<li>it is possible for experience gains to overflow; the most common example would probably be killing too many cats results in the Cat Lord giving only 1 xp,
but there are other possibilities as well
<li>+Crit armor does not improve critical hits rate
<li>killing something using PoCC doesn't yield any xp
<li>Elementalists don't get fire resistance at level 6, but they should
<li>the formula for potential attribute gains (e.g. from corpses) is bugged; it's 100% likely at 28 -attribute-, but 55% at 22 (and is odd in between)
<li>cursed scrolls of repair will "break" normally unbreakable equipment, like herbs and potions
<li>PCs with high Swimming skill use more energy to move while in water than PCs without Swimming
<li>darkness does not work on door squares
<li>fireproof blankets work better with BadLuck (see also <a href="adomgb-0-14.html#0ee">0.14.14</a>)
<li>invisible monsters yield double xp even when the PC has +SeeI
<li>door traps set off by monsters will attribute kills to the PC
<li>bats do see in the dark, but don't see invisible
<li>covered pit bug - If a PC digs a hole, and proceeds to cover the hole with a plain blanket, instead of a covered pit trap appearing, the trap will magically
transform into whatever kind of trap is appropriate for that square
<li>entering 0 when using the Wizard's <tt>r</tt>echarge wands ability causes the wand to disappear without any further effect or message; just hitting Enter causes overcharge
<li>blind PCs cannot insert orbs into anomalies on D:48
<li>pissing off the Balance god via reading tract of order/chaos is incorrectly displayed as pissing off the Order god
<li>while staying on top of a pit, one can repeatedly activate the trap to repeatedly fall into the pit, without having to climb out
<li>aquatic beings can be tamed and then taken for a walk on the mountains
<li>raised corpses slowly decompose until they crumble - however if they are out of sight they do not die and have a negative amount of hitpoints
<li>if wearing a ring of teleport control and have +TCtr intrinsic, you can lose the ability to control teleportation by drinking from pool, despite wearing the ring (unconfirmed)
<li>room effects don't take darkness/invisibility into account
<li>to avoid a falling door trap, the PC jumps back on the square that he came from; if this is blocked, the PC won't jump anywhere, despite there might be another vacant square
<li>gold has hidden B/U/C status: if you have 19 or less gold pieces, you can dip the entire stack into a potion of unholy water; then wield 1 gp in either hand - the gold piece
cannot be removed; this does not work when you have more gold - the stack will remain uncursed; similarly, angry deity can curse wielded gold

<a name="0f8"></a><h4>0.15.8 Rumors</h4>
Rumors in general are available from several sources:

the end of the list below. The list, along with some explanation:

<a name="0f9"></a><h4>0.15.9 Final score</h4>
The algorithm presented here is revised to reflect experiments conducted in April, 2008:
<pre>
score = sum of all skill scores / 20 +
    spell memory [the first number] for each known spell / 5 + 50 +
    MIN(piety - 200, 10000000) +
    (level - 1) * 50 +
    experience / ~3.5 +
    (sum of the danger ratings [1-50] of explored levels) * 30 +
    (# identified items * 100) +
    various amounts for having intrinsics (between 200 and 10000 each) +
    ~2000 (retrieving the cute puppy) +
    20000 (making Blup happy) +
    (sum of attribute modifications * 200) +
    (# of successful dwarven quests * 5000) +
    5000 (if member of thieves guild) +
    5000 (if head of thieves guild) +
    1000 (adhering to the principles of the Cat Lord)
    250000 (saving Khelavaster) +
    2000000 (being a paragon of order) +
    MAX(0, 300 - max. hitpoints) * 1000 (only if the game was completed) +
    20000 (no divine interventions and game complete) +
    20000 (champion) +
    -10000 (fallen champion) +
    -(chaos score * 20) (typical about 1000 points score per corruption)
</pre>
This score is doubled if you managed to solve the major goal of the
game. If you managed to solve the game and leave the Drakalor Chain the
following is added to that score:<p>
MAX(0, 80000 - moves) * 1000<p>
Then the score is once more doubled.<p>
