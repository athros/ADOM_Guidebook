<a name="06"></a><h3>Attributes</h3>
A basic description of the attributes can be found in the <a href="adomman-H.html#H1">ADOM Manual</a>.
The current value for attributes is displayed on the main
game screen. The current value and the potential maximum value for the PC's
attributes can be found on the screen shown by the <tt>@</tt> command.<p>

Attributes can increase or decrease for many reasons, some of which are detailed
below. When an attribute changes, the following messages are generated:<p>

<a name="060"></a><table border=1>
<caption>Attribute changes</caption>
<tr><th>Attribute<th>Increases <th>Decreases
<tr><td>Strength <td>Your muscles feel stronger. <td>Your muscles soften.
<tr><td>Learning <td>You feel studious. <td>Thinking seems to get tougher.
<tr><td>Willpower <td>Your will seems inflexible. <td>You feel soft-hearted.
<tr><td>Dexterity <td>Your movements are getting swifter. <td>You are getting shaky.
<tr><td>Toughness <td>Your health increases. <td>It seems that you are getting a cold.
<tr><td>Charisma <td>You feel very self-confident. <td>You feel reserved.
<tr><td>Appearance <td>Your looks improve. <td>You are growing a wart.
<tr><td>Mana <td>You feel more in touch with the world. <td>You are getting out of touch with everything.
<tr><td>Perception <td>Your senses sharpen. <td>You seem to get less perceptive.
</table><p>

<a name="061"></a><h4>0.6.1 Increasing attributes</h4>
It is to any PC's advantage to raise attributes to the potential maximum and beyond.
There are several ways to do this. Attributes may be increased to their potential
maximum (and beyond) naturally by training the attribute.<p>

<a name="0611"></a><h4>0.6.1.1 Training attributes naturally</h4>
<table border=1><caption>How to train attributes naturally</caption>

</table><p>

The Athletics skill also helps raise physical attributes (St, Dx, To) more quickly and has a half
effect on Appearance. It trains twice as fast if attribute &lt; 10, and three times as fast if
attribute &lt; 5. It happens at only level up, basic effect is skill level x 100.<p>

<a name="06111"></a><b>Training explained</b><p>
Training value is associated with every attribute, ranging from -5000 to 5000.
Natural training happens once in 500-1000 turns, and always at level up. Every level
up trains every attribute by level if it's not at potential max. If St &lt; 10, train by 100 at
level up, if &lt; 5 another 100. Also with Toughness.<p>

There is a chance that the attribute will be increased or decreased on each check.
No training occurs if Training=0, if Training&gt;0 then an attribute increase is possible, otherwise
an attribute decrease is possible.<p>

If the attribute isn't at maximum (or Training is negative), number from 1 to N is rolled randomly,
and if abs(Training) &gt; RolledNumber,
then the attribute is increased or decreased. It means the smaller N, the bigger chance for an attribute change.
If Learning &gt; 9 (or Training is negative), N = X * (attribute+10), otherwise N = X * (attribute+20-Le).
X=50 if Training is positive, X=10 if negative; it means negative training generates 5 times smaller
N, thus is 5 times more effective. If the attribute was increased, Training is decreased by 1000 points, but
not below zero. If an attribute decrease occured, Training is set to 0.<p>

If the attribute is at its potential (and Training is positive), or it is not at potential but 1/10 chance, (another)
number from 1 to attributePotential*100+750 is rolled randomly. If Training &gt; RolledNumber, then the attribute potential
goes up and Training is decreased by (another) 2000 points, but not below 0.<p>

Finally, another 1000 points of Training are removed, not below 0. To sum up, PC loses 1000 points
of Training on unsuccessfull check, 2000 on attribute increase, 3000 on potential increase, and 4000
on attribute and potential increase.<p>

<a name="0612"></a><h4>0.6.1.2 Training with Garth</h4>
The dwarven weaponmaster Garth, found in Dwarftown, can be paid to increase
attributes other than Appearance and Mana.<p>

See section <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#355">3.5.5</a> for a bit more detail on training with Garth.<p>

<a name="0613"></a><h4>0.6.1.3 Training attributes with herbs <tt>"</tt></h4>
Two of the herbs can be used in order to increase attributes to a maximum of
about 25-27 per attribute. These are:
<ul>
<li>Morgia root - Willpower and Toughness (eat)<p>
Morgia Root trains Toughness up to 25, 5d100+200; trains Willpower up
to 25, 50d10. B/U/C <i>doesn't matter</i>. About 18 are needed to guarantee 
Willpower increase, however usually about 8 is enough.
<!--
Eating 2 morgia roots, any status, will train Toughness. Eating 4 morgia
roots, any status, will also train Willpower. If the attributes are already
at their potential maximum, 8 morgia roots are required. Eating more than
8 at once is a waste of morgia roots. (given the exact formulae above, this
could be regarded as myth) <p>-->

<li>Moss of mareilon - Dexterity (use)<p>
Using Moss of Mareilon trains Dexterity up to 25, Cursed: -10d100,
Uncursed: 10d100, Blessed: 60d30+30. About 6 blessed patches are needed to
maximize chances for increase.
<!--
Using 2 blessed or uncursed mosses of mareilon trains Dexterity.
Blessed herbs have much greater effect. If the Dexterity is already
at its potential maximum, 4 mosses of mareilon
are required. Using more than 4 at once is a waste of moss of mareilon.
Using cursed mosses of mareilon abuses the Dexterity attribute. (given the exact
formulae above, this could be regarded as myth) <p>-->
</ul><p>

<b>Tip:</b> when your Wi/To
attributes or your Dx attribute is 24 and the natural maximum is greater than 24 (in
other words, when one more increase would put you to 25), use all of the
morgia and not cursed moss of marelion you can, since once you hit 25, the herbs
become useless. But if you pack on the training at 24, you may still get another
increase or two after you hit 25, from the remainder.<p>

In any case, do not eat or use additional herbs until the attribute increases
have taken effect - this may take a while.<p>
<!--
Note that training attributes in
this way is more effective when the attributes are low. Eating four morgia, for
instance, may cause two or three increases in Willpower and Toughness if
the attributes are in the single digits. Once above ten, the attribute increases
seem to occur one point at a time. (myth - see formulaes above)<p>-->

<a name="0614"></a><h4>0.6.1.4 Increasing attributes by eating corpses <tt>%</tt></h4>
Many corpses have an affect on attributes. Some simply increase a given attribute,
others will increase one attribute while decreasing another. Some have a limit,
that is, they will only increase an attribute to a certain number, after which
they will have no effect. Others affect attributes regardless of their value.<p>

For example, spellcaster corpses have 17% probability of granting +1 Ma,
except for kobold shaman corpse, which always grants +1 Ma, but also causes sickness.
Refer to section <a href="adomgb-0-3.html#033">0.3.3</a> for the other effects resulting
from eating monster corpses.<p>

<a name="0615"></a><h4>0.6.1.5 Increasing attributes with potions <tt>!</tt></h4>
There are five kinds of potions that increase or decrease the PC's attributes
directly: potions of -attribute-, potions of potential -attribute-, potions of boost
-attribute-, potions of gain attributes and potions of carrot juice. Rearranging
attributes is dealt with below.<p>

Potions of -attribute- behave as follows:
<ul>
<li>Uncursed potion of -attribute-: an uncursed potion of -attribute- will increase the value
of -attribute- by one, and increases the potential maximum plus one.

<li>Blessed potion of -attribute- : a blessed potion of -attribute- will increase the value of
-attribute- by two, and increases the potential maximum plus two.

<li>Cursed potion of -attribute- : a cursed potion of -attribute- will decrease the value of
-attribute- by one, and decreases the potential maximum by one.
The effect of cursed potions of -attribute- and cursed potions of potential -attribute- is worse
if the PC is cursed and/or doomed. -2 points if you're cursed, -3 if doomed, -4 if both.

<li>Potions of potential -attribute- do the same with your attribute potential, which determines
the natural maximum of your PC in that attribute.

<li>Potions of boost -attribute- work like potions of -attribute-, but give a bigger boost that
is <i>temporary</i>. These are useful when you need to get some attribute over a certain
limit, such as the Wi: 32 border that allows for bigger ball spells. Another useful
application is to use potions of boost learning just before a level increase, which
will probably boost learning enough to increase the number of skill increases
allowed.

<li>Potions of gain attributes raise the value of a single attribute by one if uncursed or
all attributes by one if blessed. Note that they do not raise potential maximums.
They only increase potential maximums to the resulting value of -attribute-, when
necessary.

<li>Potions of carrot juice can be used to increase Perception. Drinking a blessed
potion of carrot juice will increase Perception by +1. Drinking an uncursed potion
of carrot juice may increase Perception if the Pe score is very low; this needs to
be tested. After 20, it becomes more difficult to raise Perception with blessed
potions of carrot juice. When Perception is below 20, the message "Your eyesight
seems to improve!" is generated. Above 20, the message is absent even if Perception
is increased. There is a special room effect "The air of this room is
filled with the smell of carrots." which will cause a one-time +5 increase to
Perception when a potion of carrot juice is consumed while in the room.
</ul><p>

<a name="0616"></a><h4>0.6.1.6 Crystals of knowledge <tt>*</tt></h4>
<tt>U</tt>sing crystals of knowledge has two possible effects: if the crystal is
uncursed, a bit of the level layout around the PC is revealed. If the
crystal is blessed, a 1d2 increase to the Learning attribute may also
occur. In ADOM 1.0.0+, there is a limit similar to that encountered with
herbs: Learning increase mostly fails around 25 - 27 or so with blessed crystals
of knowledge.<p>

<a name="062"></a><h4>0.6.2 Rearranging attributes</h4>
<a name="0621"></a><h4>0.6.2.1 Potions of exchange <tt>!</tt></h4>
Drinking a potion of exchange changes your attributes, not taking into account any
effects from corruption or equipment. A cursed potion of exchange swaps six attributes
randomly, an uncursed one twists five, and a blessed one swaps two attributes around.<p>

<a name="0622"></a><h4>0.6.2.2 Potions of balance <tt>!</tt></h4>
Potions of balance can be very, very helpful if you know how to use them.
When you drink one, the game calculates the average of all of your attributes,
rounds it down, and adds a number depending on the potion's status. For a
blessed potion, it's +3, uncursed 0, and cursed -3. The attribute changes are based
on this final score.<p>

If an attribute exceeds this score, it's lowered by one. If it's below this, it's
raised by one. If it's equal, it remains unchanged.<p>

Therefore, if you have a well-rounded character, with most or all attribute scores
close to each other and drink a blessed potion of balance, you will get a
boost to most or all attributes.<p>

However, this only happens with 100-4*(attributeAverage-10) % chance. This means 100%
chance for attribute averages of 10, 0% for 35. The B/U/C status of the potion is counted
towards that attributeAverage as explained earlier. Otherwise, alignment is moved
towards neutrality instead.<p>

Note also that potions of balance take into account all attribute-modifying elements
including worn equipment, wielded equipment and corruptions.<p>

<a name="063"></a><h4>0.6.3 Increasing attributes beyond their usual limits</h4>
Certain afflictions will lower attributes. While suffering from these, the PC can take
advantage of this fact to increase her attributes. Once the affliction wears off or is
removed, the attribute will recover and exceed the usual limit.<p>

<b>Sickness:</b> -2 to several attributes; -5 to Toughness<p>

<b>Starvation:</b> -4 to Strength as soon as Starving status is reached. As time passes,
Strength, Learning, Willpower and Dexterity begin dropping. They will eventually reach
half their starting value (Strength reaches half the value after the immediate -4). While
the attributes are dropping, the PC is not in danger of starving to death. When the attributes reach the
halfway point, the PC is in danger of dying and should eat something. Since Starvation halves
attributes rather than simply decrementing them it is much more powerful than Sickness.<p>

<b>Rings of weakness:</b> Decreases Strength to 2. Be careful to drop the PC's pack (and heavy
worn equipment ie. Big Punch) before using rings of weakness.<p>

An extremely convenient scenario for these tactics is mining out a level that supports herbs.
Morgia roots and moss of mareilon train Toughness, Willpower and Dexterity. Stomacemptia can be
used for Starvation. Mining will generate crystals of knowledge for training Learning and Stone
Giant corpses for increasing Strength. Even better if it is near Dwarftown. Most PCs will not
have the Mining skill or an artifact pickaxe and will need Glod's help repairing pickaxes for
1500 gold pieces. This exploit should raise these attributes into the 50s.<p>

<b>Garth</b> (section <a href="adomgb-3-5.html#355">3.5.5</a>) is a potentially endless source of
attribute increases for those attributes he trains. The limitless gold available from the Casino can be
used for this.<p>

<a name="064"></a><h4>0.6.4 Luck</h4>
Luck is a hidden property of the PC, which is not stored anywhere, but rolled
whenever needed. This Guidebook sometimes references to Luck. The following table
explains how Luck is calculated.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Luck modifications</caption>
<tr><th>Condition <th>Luck modification
<tr><td>Being Blessed <td>+2
<tr><td>Birthday <td>+1d12+1
<tr><td>+Luck intrinsic <td>+3
<tr><td>+Fate intrinsic <td>+6
<tr><td>Ankh or platinum girdle equipped <td>+3
<tr><td>Correctly equipped item that grants +Luck <td>+2
<tr><td>Correctly equipped item that grants +Fate <td>+4
<tr><td>Always <td>if 1d100 &lt; Ma then +Max(1d(Ma/10+2)-1,4)
<tr><td>+Curs intrinsic <td>-2d2
<tr><td>+Doom intrinsic <td>-3d5
<tr><td>Correctly equipped items that grants +Curs <td>-1d(Number of +Curs items * 3)+1
<tr><td>Correctly equipped items that grants +Doom <td>-1d(Number of +Doom items * 8)+1
<tr><td>Savegame cheating <td>-1d200
</table><p>

The actual Luck roll is 1dGoodLuck-1 + BadLuck, where GoodLuck are conditions which increase Luck,
and BadLuck are conditions which decrease luck (last 5 rows from the above table). This gives overall
positive or negative bonus to the situation. Note that being Doomed in itself will also further impact
many situations beyond the Luck roll penalty above.<p>

<a name="065"></a><h4>0.6.5 Speed</h4>
The speed system is well covered in the <a href="adomman-O.html#O3">ADOM Manual</a>.
The following table quantitates the means of modifying PC's speed.<p>

<table border=1><caption>Speed modifiers</caption>
<tr><th>Activity <th>Speed modifier
<tr><td>Slowed (Slow Monster, or by an opponent) <td>	-50%
<tr><td>Overburdened! <td>-40
<tr><td>Strained! <td>-20
<tr><td>Strained <td>-10
<tr><td>Bloated <td>-10
<tr><td>Burdened <td>-5
<tr><td>Satiated <td>-5
<tr><td>Drunk <td>-5
<tr><td>Starving <td>-5
<tr><td>Talents (Quick, Very Quick, Greased Lightning) <td>+2, +5, +9
<tr><td>Athletics skill <td>up to +8
<tr><td>Raven birthsign <td>+10
<tr><td>Dexterity <td>+1 for every 2 points above 17
<tr><td>Wish <td>+20d20, +1 permanent
</table><p>

Monks and Beastfighters also receive speed bonuses as they level. Some items such
as a quicksilver staff, ring/amulet of speed, and the artifacts Black Torc,
Ring of the Master Cat and Boots of Great Speed can also increase the PC's speed.
Corpses of monster such as quicklings and claw bugs and potions of quickling blood
can also increase base speed. Slow Monster spell, boots of the slow shuffle, moloch armors,
armor of sloth, high burden and high satiation can be used to guarantee speed increases
from corpses, akin to sickness/starvation training for attributes.<p>
