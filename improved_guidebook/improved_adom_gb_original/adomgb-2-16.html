<h3>Sinister Library of Niltrias</h3>

The layout of the Library is as follows:

</pre>

The numeral <tt>1</tt> represents secret doors.<p>

The Ghost Librarian <tt>G</tt> is nonhostile (see the section below).<p>

There is a certain amount of variation in the items found in the
Library; this map was generated with a Wizard PC. The items in
the eastern chamber and the large main room will be scrolls rather
than spellbooks for non-wizards. This is a good thing, since
scrolls are useful for all classes, while non-spellcasters are
often unable to read spellbooks efficiently or at all. Note the
<tt>]</tt> in the southwest corner. It is a climbing set, which is required
to get back into the Rift dungeon. Equipment may be destroyed while
in the Library, so it is prudent to leave the climbing set where it
is until the PC is finished with the rest of the Library. There
will be monster guardians found on top of every spellbook or scroll.
These monsters can be anything and are uniformly dangerous. Master lich,
ancient dragons, quickling lord, frost giant jarl, stone giant lord, moloch
and mimic hivemind were found among others. It is wise to bring
dragon slaying ammo in case an ancient karmic dragon is generated.
Likewise, demon slaying ammo or phase daggers are very nice to have
in case a (greater) moloch is generated.<p>

Wizards and Necromancers who visit the Library will find every spellbook available
in the game, including Wish. Other classes will not.
They find scrolls in the two large rooms and spellbooks in
the small northeast room and the hidden passageway.
Spellbooks can be destroyed while in the Library (by blue dragons,
for example), so be careful with rare spellbooks.<p>

<a name="2g1"></a><h4>2.16.1 Ghost Librarian <tt>G</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 55, PV: 0, Hits: 125, Attacks: 2, Damage: 3d10+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
The Ghost Librarian will bless the PC for 2000 turns if <tt>g</tt>iven a scroll or book.<p>

The player should be careful to ensure the Ghost Librarian's safety. Since the librarian
is non-hostile, the monsters that guard the stacks might potentially attack her.
It's a good idea to use a wand of door creation to seal off the library's lobby.
Even then, monsters that teleport or smash doors might potentially get in and kill her.<p>

The Ghost Librarian is the source of an important artifact, the Weird Tome.
<pre>
-------------------------------- weird tome --------------------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d2
points of damage.
</pre>

In order to obtain the Weird Tome the PC must have Stealth at 100 and spend
at least 2000 turns in the Library without <tt>C</tt>hatting to monsters.
Wizards, for instance, can cast spells throughout their combat in the Library
and, after vanquishing the monsters, read some spellbooks to pass time before
<tt>C</tt>hatting to the Ghost Librarian. At that point the Ghost Librarian will
reward the PC with the Weird Tome, which can be exchanged for five cursed
scrolls of chaos resistance courtesy of the Mad Minstrel. Getting the Weird Tome
sets Literacy to 100. If the PC <tt>C</tt>hats with the Ghost Librarian too soon,
she responds with "Respect the Silence!" and the 2000 turn counter is reset.
If 2000 more turns pass in silence, the Weird Tome can still be obtained.<p>

It is impossible to read the Weird Tome. The message generated is:
<pre>
This book is filled with strange texts written in weird
letters. You have difficulties concentrating on the text. After a while
you manage to focus your sight on the text. The text contains a strange
collection of tunes, songs and instrumental pieces. It seems to be some
kind of code, hinting at some ancient powerful magic, a scroll or
something like that... You fail to decipher it.
</pre>
Most characters who attempt to read the Weird Tome are Confused for a
considerable length of time (20d100 turns). Do not try it in a potentially dangerous
location! You can only read the Weird Tome if you are Bard, have both Literacy and
Music at 100, have 50+ Willpower and 60+ Learning.<p>

The 2000 figure for the turns spent without <tt>C</tt>hatting may not be an absolute.
There may be a die roll for a very small chance that a PC will be unable to get
the Weird Tome no matter the length of the wait.<p>

Research on the Weird Tome is far from complete. See section <a href="adomgb-5.html#55">5.5</a>
for details.<p>
