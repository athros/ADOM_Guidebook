# ADOM Guidebook

I'm converting the text found at http://www.adomgb.info - the websites linked in the html and text files no longer exists. I am going to convert it to Github Markdown, and then allow pull requests if folks want to update the information. I will likely go on to do the FAQ afterwards.

I dislike using the wiki as it takes a while to load with all of the ads that they use. Since the site is likely paid for by the ads, I disabled my adblockers for the wiki.

This is based on the work done by Andy Williams, and I have included the original text wholly and completely, before any changes, in the repo. 

Without further ado:
