2.                        MID-GAME STRATEGIES


2.1 The early levels of the Caverns of Chaos (CoC)

The early levels of the CoC should not be a problem for PCs that manage to make it this 
far. They are comparable in difficulty to the Village Dungeon or the Unremarkable Dungeon. 
It is never wise to become overconfident, however. Even these levels may contain lesser 
vaults, tension rooms and named artifact guardians. There may be a split in the early 
dungeon levels of the CoC. Two down staircases may be available. This is by no means 
guaranteed.

When two down staircases are found on D: n (n=1, 2 or 3), the level D: n+1 has a roughly 
50% chance of containing a lesser vault. The level S: n+1 will never contain a vault. 
This suggests the S level may stand for 'S'afe or 'S'hortcut.

The main objective in the early part of the CoC is to find the Arena. More about the 
Arena level is found in section 2.2.


2.2 The Arena

The Arena level is found around D: 4. As might be expected at a huge attraction like the 
Arena, there are vendors selling items on this level.  The other guaranteed monster 
on the level is the Arena Master, who provides access to the Arena.  Note that he will 
not admit invisible PCs to the Arena, whether or not they have fought in the Arena 
before. He responds with "Sorry, we've hired more than enough invisible stalkers. Look 
for a job elsewhere or come back when some of yer pals are used up."

The Arena itself is for combat practice, with the rewards for a successful fight being 
gold pieces. The rewards get larger as the PC wins more fights. A PC should not fight 
more than nineteen times in the Arena before descending to deeper levels of the CoC. This 
is because he will encounter an NPC later who assigns a quest to win the 20th Arena fight. 
The 20th fight will be against a named former champion. These opponents are more difficult 
than the standard Arena opponents. There are four possibilities:

Li-Hon-Kay: ogre magus, uses invisibility and Frost Bolt, alternate name Li-Han-Kay
Spardakius: minotaur, brute force
Ripclaw: troll, brute force
Bonk: hill giant, brute force

Li-Hon-Kay can be particularly annoying and dangerous. PCs without cold resistance and the 
ability to see invisible will probably not survive a fight with Li-Hon-Kay. Fortunately, 
cold immunity and the ability to see invisible are granted by the Ancient Mummy Wrapping, 
an artifact armor held by Rehetep, the Mummy Lord (see section 2.9). Players who want to 
be conservative and maximize the chances of survival in the 20th Arena fight will tackle 
the Pyramid first. Note also that although ogre magi are somewhat resistant to confusion, 
if one is successfully confused using Mindcraft, they are unable to become invisible. This 
works for Li-Hon-Kay as well as ordinary ogre magi. The other 20th fight Arena opponents 
will fall to offensive magic or simple brute force bashing.

There are a limited number of fights available after the 20th fight, but beware: anything 
can be generated as an opponent in such fights. It is quite possible to be faced with an 
emperor lich or ancient karmic dragon. The monetary rewards for such fights are about 1000 
gold pieces each, not worth it if the PC has to face a difficult opponent.

Timofei Shatrov has determined the possible opponents the PC will face in the Arena.  There 
are five possible opponents in each fight, although some of them are duplicates.  The table 
below shows the possible opponents, with cats in capitals and duplicates in parentheses:

POSSIBLE ARENA MONSTERS:

 1 - giant rat      kobold           rat            goblin        (giant rat)
 2 - giant rat      kobold           orc            goblin        (giant rat)
 3 - gnoll	    hobgoblin	     orc            rabid dog     (hobgoblin)
 4 - gnoll          orc scorcher     hobgoblin      skeleton      zombie

19 - cave bear      dark sage        tarantula      fire lizard   dark elven warrior


2.2.1 Ratling traders

There are several ratling traders on the Arena level who sell food. The best food source 
is cooked lizards, which weigh only 3 stones each and are very nutritious. Also available 
are fried bats, which are less nutritious but still acceptable. It is not worth buying rat 
tails or cooked roaches. They have a negative nutrition value, even for trolls, who can 
eat almost anything.

In contrast to shops, which restock dependent on total game time passed, the ratling 
traders seem to restock dependent on game passed on the Arena level only. Thus a PC may go 
off adventuring for many days, return to the Arena and find no new food available. Wait or 
run around on the level for a while and the traders should eventually restock.

It is worthwhile to 'n'ame the ratling traders according to the wares they sell. This 
prevents aimless searching for the traders who sell worthwhile food. They can also be 
slowed down with the Slow Monster spell, which will not turn them hostile.


2.2.2 Cats in the Arena

Cats in the Arena are a special problem.  If the PC wants the Ring of the Master Cat, 
directly killing cats must be avoided (see section 0.9.2).  There are several ways to deal 
with cats in the Arena.  Teleportation is one, from a wand or spell.  Potions of exchange 
thrown at a cat will turn it into another monster.  A cat can be led over a trap until it 
is killed, teleported or turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos.  However, if the PC 
creates or sets off a trap which kills a cat, he is charged with killing the cat. Thus 
teleportation and corruption traps are really the only useful traps worth creating as far 
as cats are concerned. Indeed, the PC should be careful about creating *any* traps in the 
Arena, since a subsequently generated cat could be killed by the trap (even after the 20th 
fight). For this reason, as well as general tactical information, it is useful to know the 
layout of traps in the Arena when they are created.  A map showing the traps produced when 
the Arena is generated on D: 3 is shown below:

  ###############.###############
  #0123456789AB0###456789AB01234#
  #123456789AB0123456789AB012345#
  #23456789AB0123456789AB0123456#
  #3456789AB0123456789AB01234567#
  ###############################

    0 - fireball      6 - arrow
    1 - pit           7 - acid
    2 - light         8 - pit (vipers)
    3 - corruption    9 - spear
    4 - stone block   A - teleport
    5 - alarm         B - water

The pattern shifts, but otherwise remains the same, and can therefore be worked out by 
creating a single trap, when the Arena is generated on other levels.


2.3 The Big Room

The Big Room is found on level six or seven of the CoC.  It is indeed one big room with 
no walls.  This means it is not possible to use corridors to restrict monster movement.  
If there are many monsters present they can always swarm the PC.  Breeders and summoners 
are thus very dangerous on this level.  If the PC does not have poison resistance this 
level is exceptionally dangerous since dark elven wizards and dark elven priestesses who 
summon poisonous spiders are guaranteed to appear sooner or later.  Breeders can get 
completely out of control on this level.  Even if they can't really hurt the PC, once a 
high enough number breed and *continue* to breed the PC can't kill them as fast as they 
are being generated.  Being trapped like this will lead to starvation eventually.  
Remember that breeders can be sterilized by a scroll of vermin control or divine 
intervention.

Herbs are guaranteed in the Big Room which leads to the dilemma of whether to stay and 
harvest herbs or flee from the constant onslaught of monsters.

Petri Sihvola has discovered a way around this dilemma. 
His post from RGRA: 


> With a bit of planning and minimal amount of equipment, it's possible

> Now, get the breeder from wherever you left it, and lure it inside the

2.4 The Si

The si (abbreviation for strange item, pronounced "see") is the first guaranteed 
artifact that most PCs will encounter, unless they have done the Keethrax quest.  
It is usually found on level 8 of the CoC.  The level message "The air of this 
level is filled with a strange smell." is always generated when entering the level 
containing the si.  It falls into the tool category and is thus represented by a ] 
character.  It always lies on a trap, so kick it off of the trap before picking it 
up if possible.

The si is an artifact that replicates.  Since they are artifacts, they are: 

1) indestructible - wield them as a melee weapon to prevent corrosion/damage from 
                    jellies if nothing better is available
2) valuable - sell them to shopkeepers: potentially limitless cash
3) sacrificial fodder - sacrifice them to the gods, although it may be more 
                        beneficial to sell them and sacrifice the gold

All of these properties together make sis rather nice items.  Always keep at least 
one.

Note that sis do not count as an artifact as far as the demented ratling is 
concerned.  Also never forget that they replicate.  They can get heavy after a 
while.  A particularly nasty effect results if sis are brought into the ID.  
On a long trip through the ID, sis will replicate to the point where they become 
annoyingly heavy.  This would not be a problem if the PC could simply drop most of 
them.  Unfortunately, they jump back into the PC's backpack before he leaves a 
level, no matter where on the level they were dropped.  Bottom line: *never* bring 
sis into the ID.


2.5 Dwarftown

Dwarftown is an important milestone in the game. It is a source of numerous helpful NPCs 
and locations, including a shop, a smithy, a coaligned altar (for non-chaotics) and a 
training hall where stats may be increased. Of equal importance is the fact that it is a 
resting place. After the descent through the upper CoC, the PC can rest here without 
constantly being assaulted by monsters. There is nothing hostile in Dwarftown initially, 
with the exception of an almost-guaranteed mimic in Waldenbrook's shop (note the empty 
space in the shop in the map below - it is a mimic).

      #######################################################################


2.5.1 Waldenbrook

Waldenbrook is the shopkeeper in Dwarftown.  His is a general store type of shop selling 
and buying a variety of goods.  He occasionally stocks an item or two of high quality, 
sometimes even an artifact.  His prices are generally reasonable.  Bear in mind, however, 
that he has the same racial prejudices as all other shopkeepers (see section 0.13.7).


2.5.2 Ruun

Ruun, the Priest in Dwarftown is always generated with the same race as the PC.  He 
presides over a small room containing an altar, which will be coaligned unless the PC is 
chaotic.  If a coaligned PC is carrying unidentified potions, it is worth 'C'hatting with 
him.  He will identify potions that have a healing effect: potions of (extra/ultra) 
healing and potions of cure poison.  If a PC whose alignment does not match the altar's 
'C'hats with him he responds with "Ye oughta convert.  Then we'll talk."

Note that converting the altar in Dwarftown (perhaps even attempting to convert it) will 
cause Ruun to become hostile, which in turn causes the entire town to become hostile.  
Luring him out of Dwarftown, killing him and then returning will not work either, as his 
shade returns to inform the dwarves of what has happened, resulting in the same scenario.  
Unless your PC knows exactly what he is doing and why he is doing it, angering or attacking 
Ruun is highly inadvisable.  See also section 2.5.8 below about the Demented Ratling 
and causing commotion in Dwarftown.


2.5.3 Thrundarr

Thrundarr is the village elder. He can provide background information on a variety of 
subjects, none of which is really crucial to completing the game. He assigns six lawful 
quests regardless of alignment. They are listed in the next section.

2.5.3.1 Thrundarr's quests, their rewards and the significance of the rewards

Several quests are available from Thrundarr once the PC achieves experience level six.  
Talking to Thrundarr about 'quest' provides access to them:

The first five quests are available in this order:


1) Slay a random creature.  This can be a very annoying quest.  Thrundarr can assign 
   anything ranging from a goblin to a Ghost Lord.  The reward is having the PC's entire 
   inventory identified or the (artifact) potion of literacy for illiterate characters.

2) Find out what is beyond the animated forest.  The PC has two choices here: traverse the 
   animated forest or bypass it and descend through the Dwarven Halls.  See section 
   2.5.3.1.1 below about these locations.  The reward for this quest is a blessed wand of 
   fireballs with twelve charges.  This comes in very handy in the Pyramid (see section 
   2.9).

   WARNING:   

   Be very careful when wandering around below Dwarftown before receiving this quest.  
   Entering the Animated Forest for even a single turn before the quest is assigned 
   results in Thrundarr refusing to assign it, instead assigning another random monster 
   quest with *no reward*.  Since the wand of fireballs (blessed with twelve charges, no 
   less) can be very useful, entering the Animated Forest before the quest is assigned is 
   very unwise.  Note that this does not occur if the PC enters the Dwarven Halls.

3) Kill the ogre tribe below Dwarftown - the staircase to this level is generated between 
   the Dwarven Mystic's room and the Green Griffon Inn.  See section 2.5.3.1.2 below about 
   this quest.  The reward is 5000 gold pieces, useful for training with Garth (see 
   section 2.5.5).

4) Become the Champion of the Arena - if the PC is already the Champion of the Arena, 
   another random monster quest is assigned - a very good reason *not* to become the 
   Champion until this quest is assigned.  Instead of a cash reward, the PC is given an 
   artifact sword, the Golden Gladius, for winning the 20th Arena fight.  Thrundarr's 
   rewards for this quest are usually pieces of equipment which vary according to the 
   class of the PC and possibly the RNG.  A couple of examples:

       A mindcrafter (probably) received:

       blessed mithril cap [+0, +2]                         [40s]
       blessed adamantium chain mail (-1, -3) [-1, +8]     [288s]
       blessed mithril girdle [+0, +2]                      [20s]
       blessed adamantium long sword (+0, 1d8+5)            [28s]
       blessed medium mithril shield [+5, +1]               [80s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       blessed adamantium boots [+0, +3]                    [89s]

       A wizard and a beastfighter both received:

       heap of 8 blessed bandages                           [16s]
       blessed waterproof blanket                           [10s]
       blessed fireproof blanket                            [10s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       heap of 5 uncursed potions of extra healing          [10s]
       uncursed potion of gain attributes                    [4s]
       uncursed potion of ultra healing                      [2s]
       blessed scroll of familiar summoning                  [2s]

   The bandages, blankets, etc. seem to be the most common set of equipment received as a 
   reward for this quest.

   These are nice enough, but of no great consequence in the context of the whole game.  
   Of greater importance is the fact that the PC now has the Golden Gladius.  It can be 
   exchanged for training with Bart the grizzled gladiator.  See section 2.5.7.1 below.

   It is also possible under some circumstances to receive the artifact dwarven shield 
   "Rolf's Saviour" as a reward for this quest.  Lawful alignment is probably a 
   requirement alomg with cooperation from the RNG.
   
5) Slay a greater daemon that has been terrorizing Dwarftown.  The daemon can be a 
   difficult opponent, particularly if it becomes entangled with the dwarves in the city.  
   Bear in mind the fact that the greater daemon can kill NPCs who may be helpful later.  
   This includes the demented ratling, which destroys the possibility of any special ending.  
   The greater daemon breathes fire and is a stat drainer.  It can be sacrificed on the 
   altar in Dwarftown.  If the PC is lucky enough to have found demon slaying ammo, use 
   it!  There will be more found later.  The reward for this quest is the artifact mace 
   Big Punch, which many PCs find useless because it is so heavy - 800 stones.  It is 
   potential sacrificial fodder.

Thrundarr's sixth quest, available at any time and often taken out of order by many 
players, is to free the spirit of Griff Bloodax, a dwarven hero who has been turned into 
an undead dwarven chaos berserker by the master necromancer Nonnak. It is necessary to ask 
him about 'portal' to obtain this quest. In return for completing this quest, Thrundarr 
provides some equipment rewards (see section 2.7) and more importantly opens the dwarven 
portal leading to the deeper CoC. Note that it is not strictly necessary to do this quest. 
Thrundarr stands on a lever that controls the portal. If he is removed from that location, 
the PC can 'h'andle the lever himself. Methods for accomplishing this include teleporting 
Thrundarr, confusing him and killing him.

Thrundarr is teleportation resistant, thus using charges from a wand of teleportation is 
not recommended unless there is no alternative. A PC with the Teleportation spell has no 
problem. Teleporting him causes no alignment drop; Thrundarr does not become hostile and 
he will still assign quests. Killing him is a rather drastic act with all sorts of 
negative consequences. Using ventriloquism on him is fairly easy, confuses him and causes 
him to wander off the lever. It causes an alignment drop roughly equivalent to killing him 
but does not curse or doom the PC nor are muscular dwarves summoned. It does make 
Thrundarr hostile after he recovers from his confusion. This causes an amusing scenario as 
the non-hostile dwarves encounter a hostile Thrundarr wandering around Dwarftown chasing 
the PC.

The PC should actually do the quest unless there is a very specific reason not to do so, 
since there are very useful artifacts generated during the quest. See section 2.7 for more 
about this quest.


2.5.3.1.1 The animated forest and the Dwarven Halls

Thrundarr asks the PC to pass through the Animated Forest and find out what lies beyond. 
He also mentions a possibly dangerous shortcut which turn out to be the Dwarven Halls 
DH: 1 and DH: 2. On approximately D: 15 there will be a level that has two down 
staircases. One leads to the Animated Forest, the other to the Dwarven Halls. It is 
impossible to tell them apart. 

Passing through the Animated Forest is a test of one's patience among other things. The 
entire level is filled with living trees milling about. The majority are not hostile but 
will of course become hostile if attacked. It is difficult to get through them without 
accidentally hitting one or more. When the PC encounters hostile trees it is best not to 
try to fight them but rather keep moving. In fact it is usually best to be as defensive as 
possible and forget about offense completely: wield two shields and use Coward tactics. 
The hostile trees will usually be left behind in the crowd. It seems to be best to keep 
moving in any case and refrain from resting on one square. Invisibility is a tremendous 
asset in the Animated Forest, but PCs usually do not have it available at this stage of 
the game. One thing to avoid entirely is any kind of fire magic in the forest. The whole 
forest becomes hostile.

The alternative to the tedium of the Animated Forest is a descent through the Dwarven 
Halls. This is much faster but potentially dangerous. Very out-of-depth monsters can be 
generated in the Dwarven Halls. If the PC has invisibility, seven league boots or anything 
that increases speed, wear them before entering in case it becomes necessary to flee. 
Exploring other than finding the down stairways is highly inadvisable.

Both of these locations can be problematic. The Animated Forest is always incredibly 
tedious. The Dwarven Halls can be a cakewalk if the PC is lucky enough to have the 
stairways generated close together. They can also be a virtual instadeath if a very nasty 
monster shows up. As Thrundarr says, "It's yer choice."


2.5.3.1.2 The Ogre Cave

There is an ogre tribe below Dwarftown which Thrundarr asks the PC to eliminate. This 
quest is relatively easy compared to getting through the Animated Forest or Dwarven Halls. 
The ordinary ogres have no special attacks and the PC should be able to bash them with 
brute force combined with missile attacks or blast them with magic. Weaker races might 
find a corpse or two that grants a strength increase. A potential problem is the ogre magi 
present on the level. They are capable of becoming invisible and casting Frost Bolt. PCs 
who have no cold resistance need to watch out for them. Wear an amulet of the cold heart 
if the PC has one. There are also a couple of ogre lords present, which are tougher than 
the ordinary ogres.


2.5.4 The Dwarven Mystic

The Dwarven Mystic is found in a 2 x 2 sealed room east of the room containing the altar. 
The most common way to get in is by teleporting. The Dwarven Mystic used to be a 
guaranteed source of the artifact dwarven rune axe Rolf's Companion for non-chaotics. In 
g16p2 he may give lawfuls the axe. Neutrals never receive the axe but rather some 
equipment which varies. It can be four scrolls of chaos resistance and/or seven blessed 
potions of insight, potions of extra healing or other equipment. Several gammas ago, 
Rolf's Companion was a very powerful artifact. In recent gammas, it has been weakened to 
the point that many players regard the possibility of getting four scrolls of chaos 
resistance from the Dwarven Mystic as an argument for neutral alignment at this point in 
the game. Chaotics will receive nothing from him. He responds with the message "It wasn't 
you I've been waiting for!"

Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to and within the 
dwarven mystic's room. However, this is only possible if Dwarftown is generated on D: 11.:

  .....^

The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created.

It is also possible to open the walls of the Dwarven Mystic's room with a wand of 
destruction. This is somewhat dangerous, since nearby townspeople, and perhaps the 
Dwarven Mystic himself, may be damaged by the blast, causing some, or all, inhabitants of 
Dwarftown to become hostile. If the player is careful, it is possible to destroy the 
walls, 'C'hat with the Dwarven Mystic and receive his rewards in the usual manner.

If a PC with non-chaotic alignment has committed a crime in Dwarftown which results in an 
alarm gong being rung and muscular dwarves being summoned, the Dwarven Mystic responds 
with a different message "Ye art doomed!" This does not result in the PC gaining the 
cursed or doomed intrinsics. A wished-for Dwarven Mystic also always responds with this 
message.


2.5.5 Garth and Training

Garth is the dwarven weaponmaster found in the training hall east of Thrundarr's room. 
Garth will train all stats except Appearance and Mana. The formula for how much to pay 
is $100 * stat value, doubled once for each 5 points over 15. Here are examples of what 
to pay Garth: 

Stat score    Payment

   1-15          100 -   1500gp (100x)
  16-20         3200 -   4000gp (200x)
  21-25         8400 -  10000gp (400x)
  26-30        20800 -  24000gp (800x)
  31-35        49600 -  56000gp (1600x)
  36-40       115200 - 128000gp (3200x)
  41-45       262400 - 288000gp (6400x)
  46-50       588800 - 640000gp (12800x)

Note that the effects of training do not happen instantaneously. The stat has simply been 
trained. The game checks every so often (and always when gaining an experience level) to 
see if a stat is eligible for an increase. This is when the stat will rise. Note also that 
it is possible to pay Garth once and receive several stat increases as a result. This is 
particularly useful for those PC's with a very low stat score in one or more categories. 
Paying Garth well in excess of the amount needed to raise the stat will result in multiple 
stat increases over time.

Note that there is a manual entry under the Attributes section that states the following:

"The potential maximum attribute scores are based on the initial attribute scores. The 
maximum for an attribute is dependent on the base score and the player race. These 
maximums can only rarely be surpassed by natural training. This is a long and arduous 
process. Only magical methods can exceed these limits with ease."

This seems to imply that Garth cannot train a stat beyond its natural maximum. This may 
be true under "reasonable" circumstances. Giving Garth massive amounts of gold may be a 
different story.


2.5.6 Glod and Smithing

Glod, the dwarven smith in Dwarftown, will teach the Smithing skill.  There is a price for 
this which seems to depend on Charisma,  Appearance or both.  The base price seems to vary 
from as low as 800 to as high as 20000 gold pieces, and seems to be heavily influenced by 
race.

Glod is also capable of removing rust from rusted items and fixing certain broken items, 
notably pickaxes, again, for a price.  It has been reported that after removing rust from 
an item a number of times, Glod will offer to rustproof the item.

After learning the Smithing skill, Glod will make his equipment available to the PC for 
a price, typically 2500 gold pieces.

It is possible to teleport Glod away from his smithy, although the details (wand of 
teleportation vs the Teleportation spell) have yet to be worked out. He wanders in 
Dwarftown but still asks for the nominal 2500 gold piece fee (seemingly telepathically, 
probably a bug) after this. However, at this point, he can be lured off the level if he 
is adjacent to a staircase, like any other inhabitant of Dwarftown. After Glod is left 
on another level, his demands for payment cease. Note that this may involve considerable 
tedium as the PC attempts to lure Glod off the level.

It is possible to kill Glod without making the rest of Dwarftown hostile, thus making 
his smithy available for free. One method of doing this involves using the greater daemon 
generated by Thrundarr's fifth quest. If the greater daemon is lured near Glod, it will 
kill Glod.


2.5.7 The Green Griffon Inn

The Green Griffon Inn holds two useful NPCs described below. It is located in the 
southeast corner of Dwarftown.


2.5.7.1 Bart

Bart provides teaching in three skills: Backstabbing, Tactics and Two Weapon Combat in 
exchange for the Golden Gladius, the artifact sword provided as a reward for winning 
the 20th Arena fight. Tactics is available only from him. He also provides some training 
in weapon skills, raising all zero level skills to level one and providing small bonuses 
to other weapon skils. The number of weapon marks that he gives seems to be (learning 
score)d10. The training in weapon skills is secondary as compared to granting the Tactics 
skill, which is of much greater importance in the game.


2.5.7.2 Torgall

Torgall is the innkeeper in the Green Griffon Inn. He is a source of rumors, for the price 
of an ale.


2.5.8 The Demented Ratling

The Demented Ratling is an important NPC for all PCs trying for a special ending. He 
demands to be fed six artifacts in exchange for revealing the secret of the Stone Circle, 
where the Crown of Chaos can be found. He will only talk to chaotic PCs. He becomes much 
more powerful each time he is fed an artifact. This is important to remember. If the PC 
is going to cause commotion in Dwarftown, for example in order to fulfill Kherab's second 
quest, it should only be done after feeding a number of artifacts to the demented ratling. 
Otherwise the demented ratling may be killed in the ensuing battle for control of 
Dwarftown.

A wished-for demented ratling will make the usual demand for six artifacts from a chaotic 
PC, but will not eat an artifact.  Instead, he responds with "Ya naw will neeta die!"  He 
is not necessarily hostile after this.

It is possible to anger the demented ratling to the point where he will attack by 
repeatedly (about five times) talking to him after giving him artifacts.


2.6 The Old Barbarian's Glade

The Old Barbarian can be found in a clearing in the center of the wilderness map. He 
assigns a quest to kill a score (20) of the monsters the PC first killed. As a reward for 
successfully completing the quest he teaches the Courage skill. The quest is only 
available to non-chaotics and is not available until the PC has killed 500 monsters.  
Note that if the PC somehow acquires the Courage skill after the quest is assigned but 
before it is completed (bard class power, potion of education), returns to the Old 
Barbarian and 'C'hats with him, he is surprised and gives the PC an ordinary two-handed 
sword.

For more about strategy for the first kill, see section 0.9.1.

Note that the Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items. He is the only 
monster ever generated in this location, so nothing randomly generated is going to run 
away with the PC's stuff. If the PC leaves items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will 
not have time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.


2.7 The Dwarven Graveyard

The Dwarven Graveyard is located in the southeastern mountains of the wilderness map. It 
cannot be found until the PC talks to Thrundarr about "portal". The portal seals the 
lower parts of the CoC until the PC finishes this quest or removes Thrundarr from his 
location in Dwarftown and 'h'andles the lever controlling the portal. It is most 
definitely worth doing the quest, since two artifacts can be found in the graveyard.

There have been conflicting reports about the rewards Thrundarr provides for accomplishing 
this quest. It is always equipment, though the status varies. Whether holy water is poured 
on Griff's grave seems to make little difference in this preliminary examination:

Griff destroyed in melee, no holy water poured on grave:

uncursed wand of digging (0 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 6 blessed potions of extra healing

a different PC, same scenario:

uncursed wand of digging (5 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 3 blessed potions of extra healing

Griff destroyed in melee, poured holy water on grave afterwards:

uncursed wand of digging (5 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (3 charges)
heap of 4 blessed potions of extra healing

Griff destroyed by pouring holy water on grave:

blessed wand of digging (2 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (2 charges)
heap of 8 blessed potions of extra healing

Using holy water on Griff's grave produces the message:

You pour some water on the ground. You are overcome by feelings of gratefulness.


2.7.1 Surface level

The surface level of the graveyard is an open plain inhabited by many, many undead. There 
are skeletons, zombies, ghuls, shadows and wights present. This is also probably the first 
time the player finds graves. Most of the graves are not of much importance, but some of 
them will contain the inscription "Great treasures are buried here." This inscription 
needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It is indeed possible to find an outstanding item, 
up to and including artifacts, in a grave marked with that inscription, but it is rare. 
Digging up graves is a chaotic act, and will always summon some kind of guardian. These 
range from lesser undead, guarding the ordinary graves, to very dangerous greater undead 
such as ghost kings and emperor lichs guarding the "Great treasures are buried here." 
graves. It is probably not worth trying to dig up the "great treasures" graves with a 
level 13-17 PC. The PC can always return later if desired. All of this regarding digging 
graves assumes the PC has a means of digging. The available methods are a pickaxe, a wand 
of digging and the Mystic Shovel spell. There is a guaranteed pickaxe in the Pyramid for 
PCs at experience level 13 - 16 (see section 2.9).

If the PC has a limited supply of undead slaying ammo use it very sparingly, if at all. It 
will be needed in the underground level.

The center of the plain contains a small building that leads to the underground level.


2.7.2 Underground level

The underground level of the dwarven graveyard contains a labyrinth which features many 
traps. It is very wise to have the Detect Traps skill while navigating this maze. Use the 
's'earch command constantly if the PC has the Detect Traps skill. The left side of the 
screen is the problematic area regarding traps. The right side of the screen is Griff's 
tomb, which has been taken over by Nonnak, the master necromancer. It contains a large 
number of undead, including ghosts, wraiths, Griff Bloodax the undead dwarven chaos 
berserker and Nonnak himself.

There are two artifacts hidden in Nonnak's lair. The elemental gauntlets are found in a 
hidden room in the center of the eastern wall. They are guarded by a bone golem and are 
almost always located on a trap. The bone golem is not difficult to defeat for a PC that 
has made it through the dwarven graveyard. The Sword of Nonnak is located in Griff 
Bloodax's grave in the center of Nonnak's lair. It is necessary to have some means of 
digging to retrieve it. The sword is quite important for wizards, mindcrafters and other 
classes dependent upon Willpower. It grants +5 to Willpower. Note that digging up Griff's 
grave to retrieve the sword is a chaotic act, like any grave digging.


2.7.2.1 Griff Bloodax

Griff Bloodax, the undead chaos dwarven berserker, is a brute force opponent. He does not 
seem to have any special attacks, though his melee attack is formidable for a level 13 PC. 
Note that Griff is teleportation resistant.  Therefore simply trying to teleport him away 
in order to reach his grave and 'u'se holy water will not work.  Using undead slaying ammo 
is very effective against him, while melee with a low-teens experience level PC may be 
difficult.


2.7.2.2 Nonnak

Nonnak is the master necromancer that created the undead guarding the tomb. He is 
vulnerable to fire-based attacks. He uses Frost Bolt as an offensive spell and has a 
mediocre melee attack. PCs without cold resistance will have a very hard time defeating 
him. He is also a summoner.


2.8 The Mad Minstrel

The Mad Minstrel lives in a hut in a clearing found in the northern central part of the 
wilderness map. He will sing songs which are somewhat cryptic hints about important parts 
of the game. If a player wants to finish the game without reading extensive spoilers, it 
is very important to sit through his concerts until the player has memorized everything 
he has to say. Alternatively, they are reproduced here along with [some interpretation]:


 "The Lord of the Cats is a touchy fellow,
His teeth are sharp and his eyes are yellow.
  All kinds of cats he calls his subjects,
  Small ones, big ones, all he'll protect.
       If kind ye be to cats, I sing,
      Talk from him his precious ring!"

[reference to the Cat Lord and felines; see section 0.9.2]

    "Felines have a shiny fur.
When you feed them, they will purr.
  True cat-lovers never harm them,
 some musicians try to charm them.
 For all others, let me warn them:
  As soon as felines meet disaster
 their energy rejoins their master."

[more reference to the Cat Lord and felines]

    "Heaven help you in the tower of hell,
The elements will surely sound your death-knell,
 If walking on fire still shrouds you in pain,
  You might just need some more of the same..."

[Tower of Eternal Flames; have two fire resistance sources 
beyond the intrinsic, which counts as two]

      "In a very hot tower
  your points in life get lower.
Resisting fire not once but twice
       Would be very wise."

[Tower of Eternal Flames; have two fire resistance 
 sources beyond the intrinsic, which counts as two]

       "A drakelings scales may be crimson red
       if a creature of fire for dinner he had
    he may wear tough scales and two rings to boot
      he may have the armour and all of the loot
          but fire is still a hazard to him
  cause a drakeling will start to burn from within.

     He will become fast, even fast as the light
  his foes may run screaming at this unearthly sight
      as quicklings so fast, he may just become
      but the hazard of fire will never be gone
  cause the speed makes him dizzy and dazy and that
  and no ring and no scales will save him from that.

      So the tower of fire is a dangerous thing
and you should really listen to the sound of my string
   for a drakeling has really a hard time in there
   without healing and stuff he won't get anywhere.
      So a potion or herb might be a good boon,
 but if you enter without them - you are just a loon!"

[warning about the special problems Drakelings have in the ToEF]

"The Banshee sings a strangely compelling song,
      No one can listen to it for long.
              You better beware
                And take care.
           Beware is what you need,
     Understand this verb and take heed."

[warning about the Banshee: bee-ware (beeswax) is what you need]

   "A small cave for beginners
   The big ones are for winners
    Do it the other way around
And strange monsters will be found."

[warning about the nature of the small cave; see section 1.2.3]

      "The trinity is very tough to find
                in case you mind.
           three parts you will need,
          lots of blood you will shed.
            Once all are collected,
      once your deceitful fame is erected,
   once in servitude you seem to be joining,
once chaos powers the word "friend" are coining,
            you'll enter the gate...
        Quickly - before it's too late!"

[advice about acquiring the Chaos Trinity; advice about the level of 
 corruption needed to enter the chaos gate (as a chaotic); do not 
 tarry or corruption will kill the PC - this is pertaining to the 
 "ordinary" chaos god ending]

            "I'm so lazy,
         My knowledge's hazy,
         My sounds are loud,
         but rarely I shout.
        My lyrics are coarse,
        I never owned a horse.
      My songs I'm improvising,
       I use them for advising.
          Listen with care,
       and well you will fare."

[warning to pay attention to these poems, though they are cryptic]

     "Ancient dwarfs
  often come in halves.

  was a monument built by the powers of Law.
        Now it's strangely distorted,

          In the depths of infinity
   it holds the first part of the trinity,
     which, once assembled and refitted,
            will make it permitted
        to become a Chaos God supreme,
     if forceful enough yourself ye deem!"

But his skin got cracked before his eyes.

    He wrapped it up in rags at first,
  But after a while the rags all burst.
         Now to keep his body in,
 He needs to borrow someone else's skin!"

The Elders Wise and Mystics Flighty
      Even they must Wonder..."

[story about Rolf the dwarven hero]

       "An age ago, there lived a king, most pious and benevolent,
  Who from his god received a ring to shield him from the elements.
      This king, he had a brother true, a fighter lion-hearted,
Who sought to rout all Chaos through the Gate from whence it started.
   He purged the evil from the land, his blade once never faltered,
       And only by his god's own hand was his adventure halted.
  "O fighter brave," his god did say, "though noble is your mission,
       Yet centuries must slip away before it finds completion.
     The Balance leans too much to Law, and I must now amend it;
    Let Chaos have its time on Earth ere back to hell you send it.
    But watch this stair eternally, and wait for Heaven's message,
    To show the mighty champion who's earned the right of passage.
    For only one you'll step aside and cease your faithful vigil:
 The one who wears your brother's ring emblazed with Heaven's sigil.""

[warning about the Eternal Guardian and hint about the Ring of the High Kings]

The Mad Minstrel is also a critical part of the special endings. More about his role in 
the special endings can be found in section 4.3.1.2.


2.9 The Pyramid

The pyramid is located in the wilderness, slightly east of the exact center of the map. 
It can be entered once the PC reaches experience level 13. When this happens, the game 
generates a message: "You suddenly feel ancient magical energies manifest in your 
vicinity." Searching the current location will reveal the papyrus scroll, which is an 
invitation to enter the pyramid. It is not necessary to read, or even find, the scroll 
for admission to the pyramid. It asks the PC to come as soon as possible. Do not be 
fooled by this. It is best to wait as long as possible before entering the pyramid, since 
it is a rather nasty place. The entrance to the pyramid closes permanently if the PC 
reaches experience level 17. Ideally the PC should reach experience level 16 and keep 
very careful track of his experience points. Approach the pyramid when the PC is close to 
achieving level 17, within a couple hundred points. Wander around in the vicinity of the 
pyramid to generate wilderness encounters. Killing monsters in the wilderness should 
enable the player to fine-tune his experience score to the point where very few additional 
points are needed to achieve level 17. Then enter the pyramid. The first couple of kills 
in the pyramid will raise the PC to experience level 17, maximizing the chances of success 
in the pyramid. Keep a *very* close eye on those experience points. You don't want to 
accidentally achieve level 17 and have the pyramid close, because Rehetep carries two 
artifacts.


2.9.1 The first two levels

The first level of the pyramid has the following layout:


 ###########                              #######
 #.........#      ############            #.....#             #######

     ####################       ##############                 ###


The numeral 1 is used to indicate the presence of a secret door. Note the traps. These are 
guaranteed traps. There will also be a number of non-guaranteed traps present. The 
location of the non-guaranteed traps changes from game to game. Also note the tools 
represented by the ( symbol. This cache of tools is guaranteed and includes thieves' 
picks, a climbing set and a pickaxe. The tools are always located on top of a trap.
The inhabitants of this level include (greater) mummies, ghosts, spectres, jackal demons, 
jackalweres, jackals and hyenas. Mummies can cause sickness. It is very unwise to enter 
the pyramid without some means of dealing with sickness. The fastest and easiest way to 
cure sickness is with blessed or uncursed curaria mancox herbs.

The second level of the pyramid has the following layout:


   ###         ###### #######
   #.###########....# #^^^^^#
   #....^.....##.######1###^#####
  ####.######....#.....^.##^#...#

  #...###.##.######.....###.###

        #######   ###     ###


Again the numeral 1 indicates secret doors. This level is very similar to the first level 
in terms of monsters and traps. There is no guaranteed equipment here.


2.9.2 The top level

The top level of the pyramid has the following layout:


      #######
     ##..Z..##
    ##.......##
#####&.......&#####
#Z@.............@Z#

There is a unique feature on this level. The down staircase, represented by the > symbol, 
changes location randomly once when the PC enters the level. This forces the PC to fight 
his way to the new location if a retreat is necessary. Furthermore, the monsters on the 
level will not follow the PC down the stairs. In older gammas of ADOM, it was possible to 
lure the monsters down the stairs one at a time and dispatch them. It doesn't work in 
current versions of the game.

The Z at the top represents Rehetep, the Mummy Lord. The remaining Zs are mummies. The & 
characters are jackal demons, which have a confusion attatck. The @ characters represent 
a random monster, generally somewhat out of depth, but not terribly so. Bear in mind that 
mummies see invisible. If the PC is fortunate enough to have a means of invisibility at 
this point, use it and take out the mummies first.


2.9.2.1 Rehetep

Rehetep the Mummy Lord holds two powerful artifacts, the Ankh and the Ancient Mummy 
Wrapping. A Greater Identify of each is below:

----------------- blessed ancient mummy wrapping [+1, +5] {Ap-8}---------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +1 and PV by +5.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

It modifies your appearance attribute by -8.
It grants resistance to sleep attacks.
It grants resistance to stunning.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
It grants IMMUNITY to cold attacks.

--------------------------------- uncursed ankh--------------------------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +2.
When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It increases your luck.
It grants luck.
It makes Fate smile upon you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the [+2, +2] nature of the Ankh is not revealed explicitly except when Greater 
Identified. Note also that it not only grants the Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics, but 
also increases luck, a hidden property used by the game when calculating dice rolls, etc.

The artifact Ancient Mummy Wrapping is the only mummy wrapping that weighs 60 stones. Be 
sure not to confuse it with other mummy wrappings. They are all described as a "strange 
wrapping" prior to identification. The resistances granted by the Ancient Mummy Wrapping 
are considerable and should give clues about how to attack Rehetep. Using cold based 
attacks is, of course, useless. Rehetep and other mummies are vulnerable to fire. This is 
where the wand of fireballs available from Thrundarr as a quest reward comes in very 
handy. Do not give up when messages about Rehetep "shrugging off" fire based attacks are 
generated. He will succumb to repeated fire attacks. All mummies including Rehetep are 
vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course.

Note that the combination of cold immunity and the see invisible intrinsic available from 
the Ancient Mummy Wrapping makes Li-Hon-Kay, a potential 20th Arena fight opponent, much 
easier to defeat.


2.10 The Gremlin Cave

The Gremlin Cave is located in the southwest corner of the Drakalor Chain. It contains 
guaranteed items: the Phial of Caladriel, which is an artifact potion, fluff balls, which 
turn into gremlins when exposed to water, and a climbing set. There are messages generated 
when the PC enters the Gremlin Cave: "You feel watched. You shiver. You shiver really bad! 
It's dark here!". The Gremlin Cave is dark and filled with water traps, which, when 
triggered by the gremlins, cause them to multiply. Things can get out of control quickly in 
this cave due to the rapid replication of the gremlins. The objective is to retrieve the 
Phial of Caladriel and optionally the climbing set. There is another guaranteed climbing 
set in the Pyramid (section 2.9). The Phial is located in the farthest possible corner 
from the entrance.

The cave is dark and gremlins are damaged by the Light spell and wands of light. An amulet 
of light, a torch, adequate castings of the Light spell or many wands of light are 
necessary simply to see and navigate the cave. The spell or wands can also be used to kill 
gremlins. If the PC is fairly buff, the Gremlin Cave can be used to train weapon skills, 
since a potentially infinite number of gremlins will be generated. They are not 
particularly difficult for a mid-level PC to kill until the PC has killed thousands.

Since there are a potentially endless number of gremlins available, it is also possible to 
use the Pick Pockets skill indefinitely. This will both train the skill and satisfy Yergius 
regarding the PC's proficiency as a thief. Bear in mind also the always-present possibilty 
of pickpocketing a truly outstanding item. While it is very rare, artifacts have been 
pickpocketed this way.

Note that it is in no way necessary to enter this cave to complete the game. It is simply 
a source of an expendable artifact which can be sacrificed, given to the demented ratling 
or sold. The climbing set is also useful of course, especially if the PC has missed the 
opportunity to enter the Pyramid.


2.11 The Assassins' Guild

The Assassins' Guild is located in the wilderness, west of the river that divides the 
Drakalor Chain. The entrance is described as "A rather boring cave entrance." It consists 
of three levels.


2.11.1 The DDL

The first level is named the DDL and contains no unique special features, although it may 
contain any of the normal dungeon features: traps, herbs, rivers, etc.


2.11.2 The VDDL

Upon entering the second level, the message "This dungeon is very dusty." is generated. 
This level contains many, many teleportation traps and can be annoying without teleport 
control. It also contains one guaranteed item: a wand of teleportation. The wand is always 
next to the down staircase found on the level in a 1 x 2 room that is separated from the 
rest of the level. It can only be reached by digging or teleportation. In practice, the 
easiest way to find the down staircase is to zap a wand of item detection. This will reveal 
the location of the wand, which the PC can then dig or teleport to, thus revealing the 
staircase. Note that it is possible for a monster to be standing on the wand, so 
teleportation may fail.


2.11.2.1 The hidden stairway and how to descend

The hidden down staircase in the VDDL is like no other in the game. It is itself a 
teleportation trap and will attempt to teleport the PC away when he tries to descend. 
Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating without teleport control. There is a 
requirement to trigger a certain number of teleportation traps on the level before the PC 
can descend. This can be done with either the normal teleportation traps or the staircase 
itself. However, it is much more efficient to use teleportation traps that are far away 
from the down staircase. They are up to six times faster at increasing the count of 
unsuccessful attempts. Just keep trying until the PC receives the message "You suddenly 
feel attuned to this area in a very special way." It is then possible to descend.


2.11.3 The final level

The final level of the Assassins' Guild has no proper name; it is only named with four 
question marks: "????". There are definite precautions necessary on this level. The PC 
initially descends into a 3 x 3 room containing four assassins. The assassins are not 
particularly dangerous opponents, although they use poison. There is a safe passage 
available through the level which is free of traps, otherwise the level is full of traps. 
The PC *must* not use missile weapons on the level. If he does, a general alarm is sounded 
and the Assassin Prince, who is very important to the special endings, becomes hostile and 
refuses to give quests later in the game. Likewise, a failed pickpocket attempt will raise 
the general alarm. Also be careful during the melee. If an assassin panics, leave him 
alone. Attacking panic-stricken assassins will also make the Assassin Prince hostile. In 
their panicked state, they make begin attacking each other or the Assassin Prince himself. 
Pay no attention to them. The level contains assassins, master assasins, holy slayers, 
gray slayers, muggers, dopplegangers and doppleganger lords.

Teleportation is not allowed on this level.

Obviously, there are some nasty monsters here and there is no particular objective for 
low-level PCs, other than killing the monsters for experience. The PC may elect to skip 
this level until much later in the game.


2.11.3.1 The Assassin Prince

The Assassin Prince is the source of the Filk Quest, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel. This 
quest is only necessary for the Ultra endings. See section 4.3.1.1 for a description of 
this quest and its requirements. If a PC is not planning to do an Ultra ending, it may be 
worth killing the Assassin Prince for the artifact dagger Sting, which he carries. Note 
two things: the Assassin Prince has been described as the offspring of a moloch and a 
quickling queen - he's not quite that bad, but he is a very difficult opponent - and 
second, Sting is really only worth acquiring if the PC has or plans to obtain its 
companion dagger Needle, available from Sharad-Waador (see section 3.9).


2.12 The Tomb of the High Kings


The Tomb of the High Kings is located in a dungeon found in the northwest corner of the 
Drakalor Chain. The PC must have a climbing set to reach it (and to leave that section of 
the map). The fact that a climbing set is required means that the PC must do some work to 
find one prior to entering the dungeon. This ensures that brand new PCs do not enter this 
location. The dungeon consists of two normal levels followed by three cavernous levels 
leading to the tomb. The cavernous levels are somewhat challenging, as are most cavernous 
levels.

The tomb itself consists of a short winding corridor leading to a large chamber. The 
chamber contains a lake which is unique in that the water is red rather than blue. This 
should serve as a warning. It is filled with chaos piranhas that deal over 200 points of 
damage during each turn the PC is in the lake. This is the place where the Bridge Building 
skill or the ability to freeze water (yielded by the Terinyo quests) becomes vital.

Teleportation is not allowed on this level, so do not count on it to get your PC out of a 
tight spot.

The PC must build a bridge or create an ice bridge to an island located in the lake. 
Remember that ice bridges will only hold the PC's weight plus 2000 stones before breaking. 
On the island is a 1 x 1 room protected by a locked and trapped door. Upon opening the 
door, a skeletal king is found guarding the Ring of the High Kings. The skeletal king is a 
somewhat nasty foe who is able to confuse the PC. This is not a good thing when the PC is 
perched on a bridge, liable to stumble to certain death in the piranha infested waters 
below. Some means of confusion resistance is therefore highly recommended. The skeletal 
king is immune to the chaos piranahs so luring him into the lake will not kill him. He is 
vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course. He is not difficult to kill in melee for a 
mid-level PC with a decent melee attack.

The objective of this dungeon, the Ring of the High Kings, 
is Greater Identified as follows:

-------------------- blessed ring of the High Kings [+2, +3]-------------------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +3.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of 
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points 
of damage.

It grants resistance to fire.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants resistance to cold.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Greater Identify does not reveal the most important property of the ring, however: 
it allows peaceful passage past the Eternal Guardian (see section 3.3).

Here is an ASCII map of the Tomb of the High Kings, showing the shortest route to the 
island formed with an ice bridge:

2.13 The Water Dragon's Lair

The water dragon's lair is located in a random water-containing square of the wilderness. 
It contains Shyssiryxius, the water dragon (Blup's mother), her treasure hoard and various 
other aquatic beasts. It consists of a labyrinth and a central room containing 
Shyssiryxius and the treasure. The entire cave is submerged, so ordinarily some means of 
water breathing and the swimming skill are required. The most common method of obtaining 
water breathing is through a helm of water breathing (generally a "blue helmet" before 
identification). Wearing two rings of the fish also grants this, although they are 
autocursing. If the PC is not born with the swimming skill, it can be obtained from Blup 
by giving him potions of carrot juice. The need for these abilities ordinarily keeps low 
level PCs out of the lair, which is as it should be. The aquatic beasts found in the 
labyrinth are not trivial, especially the dragon turtles. Sharks and giant eels can also 
be found.

In theory a PC with on demand teleportation, high hit points and possibly some regeneration 
could survive a teleport to Shyssiryxius, a chat and a teleport to the up stairs without 
water breathing or swimming.

There are two main reasons for entering. The first is to 'C'hat with Shyssiryxius then 
return to Terinyo. This allows the PC to inform Blup about the location of his mother, 
which results in eventual delivery of the rune-covered trident, a decent artifact weapon 
and missile, later in the game. The trident is delivered not long after reaching character 
level 16 for PCs born in the Raven starsign. Others have to wait until level 36. The 
location of the lair is not decided until the PC starts searching for it, so it is more or 
less possible to place it in a convenient location, such as near Terinyo.

The second reason for entering the lair is to loot it. There are occasionally outstanding 
items found in the treasure hoard. As might be expected, Shyssiryxius does not take kindly 
to thieves and will attack.

Note that delivery of the rune-covered trident is guaranteed once the PC informs Blup of 
Shyssiryxius' location. The PC may then proceed to loot the cave, or indeed even kill 
Shyssiryxius without forfeiting the rune-cavered trident.


2.13.1 Shyssiryxius

Under normal circumstances, Shyssiryxius is not hostile, only intimidating.  If she is 
'C'hatted with, she roars "HAST YE SEEN MY BABY?" (or "*DIE*" if the PC has done something 
to make her hostile).  Whether she is hostile or not, the PC can leave after chatting and 
report back to Blup.  This of course assumes a PC facing her when she is hostile survives 
(see below).  If the PC attempts to steal from her treasure hoard, she gives a warning about 
not picking anything up.  If the PC persists, she will attack.  She is a formidable opponent 
with a reasonably powerful melee attack and a deadly water breath attack that is capable of 
dealing circa 100 points of damage in a single round.  She regenerates and is immune to cold.  
She is capable of teleporting and does so when she panics, making the PC work to find her 
while remaining underwater the whole time.  She can be killed, but it takes an upper level 
PC, and it doesn't hurt to have some blessed potions of extra healing along.


2.14 Khelavaster

Khelavaster is the sage who revealed the prophecy about the coming of chaos. He entered the 
dungeons in the Drakalor Chain never to be seen again. The PC eventually encounters him 
below Dwarftown, after the Dwarven Halls or Animated Forest, generally on D: 16. By this 
time Khelavaster is mortally wounded and surrounded by chaos servants.


2.14.1 Saving Khelavaster

At this time the PC must make a choice about saving Khelavaster. He is on the down 
staircase and it is impossible to descend further without saving him or allowing him to 
die. It is however, possible to ascend, leaving the level in its state as found for an 
indefinite period of time. He can only be saved by giving him an amulet of life saving 
*before* 'C'hatting with him. There is no guaranteed way to obtain an amulet of life saving 
and they are very rare items. If the player is determined to attempt an ultra ending, 
Khelavaster must be saved since he is the only one capable of summoning the Trident of the 
Red Rooster.

Common methods of attempting to get an amulet of life saving include staying in the 
infinite dungeon until one is generated or draining every pool the PC has found in the 
hopes of obtaining a wish. A ring of djinni summoning may also be generated in the infinite 
dungeon, which provides a wish when blessed.


2.14.2 Khelavaster's gifts

In any case, Khelavaster reveals a bit about the plot of the game including the existence 
of the chaos orbs and their general locations. He also leaves some equipment for the PC. 
The equipment he leaves depends on whether he is saved or dies. The equipment is 
guaranteed, but if he is allowed to die the exact status varies. Three examples are shown 
below.

cursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +2] {Dx +2}
blessed amulet of protection +2
uncursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
cursed wand of digging (4 charges)
cursed potion of invisibility
474 gold pieces

uncursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+5}
uncursed amulet of protection +2
uncursed eternium dagger (+1, 2d4+7)
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)
uncursed potion of invisibility
271 gold pieces

uncursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+2}
uncursed amulet of protection +2
cursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)
cursed potion of invisibility
406 gold pieces

If Khelavaster is saved, the equipment he leaves is (almost) exactly the same every time:

blessed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
blessed wand of digging (8 charges)
heap of 4 blessed potions of ultra healing
heap of 6 blessed scrolls of chaos resistance
blessed spellbook of Identify
blessed spellbook of Teleportation

Note the quality of this equipment. The six blessed scrolls of chaos resistance alone are 
roughly equal to two wishes. Thus it is definitely worth spending a wish to obtain an 
amulet of life saving for Khelavaster.

The exact stats of the eternium dagger may vary. A recent report (Feb 26, 2001) revealed 
that the dagger may be as good as (+0, 2d4+10).

If Khelavaster is saved, he reappears in invisible form in Terinyo late in the game. If the 
PC gives him the crumpled scroll, obtained by killing the Emperor Moloch, he will summon 
the TotRR for non-chaotics. There is apparently an experience level requirement in order 
for Khelavaster to appear in Terinyo, but the PC does not need to have the crumpled scroll.


2.15 The CoC Graveyard

The graveyard level in the CoC is found on D: 17. The layout is as follows:

The northern tunnel contains ghuls, skeletons, zombies, shadows, wights and wraiths. 
Ghosts may pass through the walls into this corridor. The central room contains, in 
addition, more dangerous undead: corpse fiends, ghosts, lichs, mummies and greater 
mummies, skeletal warriors, spectres and vampires. The monsters here who see invisible 
are: mummies, greater mummies and lichs.

The graves are diggable. See section 2.7 concerning digging up graves. See Appendix J for 
monster characteristics.


2.16 The Water Temple

The Water Temple, found on either D: 19 or D: 20, is the first elemental temple that most 
PCs will encounter. The layout, on the left side of the level, is as follows:


   ##########################            #######

   ##########################                        ########### #######


The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging.  Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the traps. Note 
the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the 
orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are 
very dangerous. The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC 
instantly should he step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of 
Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in 
the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Water Temple are 
arrayed as follows:

They are: s - water snakes
          x - water grues
          & - water demons
          C - chaos servants
          E - water elementals
          s - (in the center) Snake from Beyond


To attack the temple, the PC must dig in, have a means of crossing the water, then attack 
the monsters. They are all vulnerable to fire based attacks. The grues and demons in 
particular are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee attack that has a very 
high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them eventually - a good reason to 
develop the PCs missile weapon skills. The snakes, including the Snake from Beyond, are 
poisonous. Invisibility is tremendously useful. The only monster found here who sees 
invisible is the Snake from Beyond.


2.16.1 The Snake from Beyond

The Snake from Beyond has been beefed up in recent gammas and is now a formidable opponent. 
It generally does not kill a PC that has made it this far, but has nasty poisonous and 
corrupting attacks that rarely miss. If possible, it should be killed from a distance, 
easier said than done in the close quarters of the Water Temple. Unfortunately, it is not 
vulnerable to any type of slaying ammo.

An examination of the Snake from Beyond with a blessed stethoscope reveals:

You examine the Snake from Beyond. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 45, PV: 22, 
Hits: 477, Attacks: 1, Damage: 12-56. Speed: 101.

Very high hitpoints and formidable DV/PV for a PC at this level.

The Snake from Beyond holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Water, 
greater identified as follows:

----------------- uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10}----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points of damage. 
When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +10.

(full heal + corruption when 'U'sed)


2.17 The Banshee


The Banshee is found on a level ranging from D: 22-24. She is an undead spirit in ghost 
form. She pines for her lost husband. Her wail is instantly fatal to most who hear it. 
PCs can prevent this in two ways. The first is by 'U'sing beeswax. This plugs the PC's 
ears, making him deaf until it is removed with the 'E' clean ears command. The second is 
by drinking a potion of deafness. Potions of deafness wear off, but the effects of an 
uncursed potion of deafness will last long enough to kill the Banshee. Using either method, 
the Banshee can then be attacked safely.

The Banshee is always found in a room in the center of the level.

Alternatively, a male character can wield a wedding ring. In this case the PC in question 
still hears the Banshee's wail, but it does not damage the PC. The Banshee is still 
hostile, however. The Banshee's wail is displayed to a male PC wielding a wedding ring as 
follows by the game:

The Banshee regards you in astonishment. "My beloooovvveed huuuusbaaaaaaaaaaannnd!"

Beware of trying to lead the Banshee around while wielding a wedding ring.  While her wail 
can be exploited (see below), this is a dangerous practice.  The wedding ring only works 
while the Banshee can see the PC, so leaving her line of sight for even a single turn can 
be fatal.

The Banshee routinely shrugs off bolt spells, but can eventually be killed using them. She 
is not difficult to kill in melee.

Players have exploited the properties of the Banshee by having her follow a deaf PC around. 
Her wail kills many monsters. A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup (January 16th, 2001) 
reveals that the trees in the animated forest are vulnerable to the Banshee's wail. As 
might be imagined, dozens of trees dying every few turns leads to some very nice treasure. 
The downside is that the Banshee will become very experienced very quickly, thus making her 
much more difficult to dispatch should the need arise. NPCs known to be immune to her wail 
include Waldenbrook, Thrundarr, the Eternal Guardian and the Casino shopkeeper. Banshees 
can be wished for. There have been reports of wished-for Banshees being effective against 
some of the monsters found on D: 50 in gamma 12, but most seem to be immune in later gammas.

A blessed stethoscope is not helpful as far as the Banshee is concerned. The game states 
the Banshee appears to be rather dead. The monster memory contains the following after 
killing the Banshee:


                       <<<<<--- Banshees (G) --->>>>>

The Banshee, a luminous spirit, manages to appear sad and angry at the same
time, obviously a being in an enraged lamentation. Her wail is renowned as it
is filled with such sorrow and hopelessness that most who hear it abandon life
instantly, passing beyond their current pains.

Banshees seem to have a DV of 40. They have a PV of about 2. They seem to
have 187 hitpoints on the average. Usually they attack 2 times. They seem
to have an average speed of about 107.

So far you have killed but one Banshee. One kill on the average seems to be
worth 61779 experience points.


2.18 Darkforge

Darkforge is an important location in the game. It is not a location for low level PCs. 
The entrance to Darkforge is described as "A long and non-descript tunnel." The first 
level of the dungeon is not particularly dangerous except for the presence of a steel 
golem guarding the down staircase. Steel golems are very tough monsters for a mid-level 
PC. If the PC has trouble with the steel golem guarding the down staircase, flee. There 
are many more guarding Darkforge itself. Upon entering Darkforge, the message "You smell 
the reek of sulphur, steel and oil." is generated. The steel golems that guard Darkforge 
are unlife and thus immune to Mindcraft. They are vulnerable to missiles of construct 
slaying, but it is almost unheard of to find enough such ammo to take them all out by this 
point in the game. They are vulnerable to Lightning, from the spell or wand, although it 
will take many castings or charges to kill all of them. Steel golems will shrug off many 
lightning attacks, but can eventually be killed this way. They breathe fire, so both the 
PC and his equipment need to be protected from fire. Many players will attempt Darkforge 
just before assaulting the Tower of Eternal Flames, in order to determine whether their 
PC has a good chance in the ToEF.

Darkforge is a very good way of gaining experience levels for PCs that can deal with the 
steel golems. A typical non-troll PC that manages to clear Darkforge of the initially 
generated steel golems will gain at least five experience levels - very useful when about 
to attempt the ToEF.

Here is an ASCII map of Darkforge. Note the caches of weapons, armor (it is possible to 
obtain artifact weapons and armor from these rooms) and gold, the room containing pools 
(which are not always generated in this pattern), the hidden room containing the Crown of 
Science (the lone [ ), the shortcut to the lower CoC and the nine forges.

It is not wise to spend inordinate amounts of time in Darkforge - for example smithing. 
Darkforge has a higher than normal rate of background corruption.


2.18.1 Kherab

Kherab is the dwarven artificer found in Darkforge. He is presumably the creator of the 
steel golems, steel horrors and animated armors found in Darkforge. He is quite tough, 
with hitpoints numbering in the hundreds and a powerful melee attack. He holds two items 
necessary for smithing: a hammer and an anvil. He is the source of two quests outlined 
below.


2.18.2 Kherab's quests and their rewards

Kherab is the source of two chaotic quests. The first is to kill Guth'Alak, the druid 
found in Terinyo. This of course removes Guth'Alak as a source of potions of cure 
corruption and as the source of the Unicorn quest. Depending on how it is accomplished, 
the entire village of Terinyo may become hostile as well. If this happens, it may destroy 
any chance the PC has to obtain the TotRR. The reward for this quest is the corrupting 
artifact amulet of raw steel. The second quest is to kill Thrundarr, the village elder in 
Dwarftown. This can have all sorts of negative effects as well, including turning all of 
Dwarftown hostile and the killing of the demented ratling. The reward for this quest is 
the corrupting shield of raw steel.

The quest rewards are useful only because they are artifacts. They can be fed to the 
demented ratling, for instance. They are too corrupting to be useful otherwise. These 
"rewards" are not really rewards. Kherab is an evil chaotic being and wants the PC dead. 
Giving away corrupting artifacts is his way of trying to accomplish this.


2.19 The Tower of Eternal Flames

The Tower of Eternal Flames, found in the Wilderness, is probably the nastiest place in 
the game given the experience level of PCs who must visit it. The layout of the Fire 
Temple itself, found on the uppermost of four levels, on the right side of the level, is 
as follows:


  #######
  #.....#                                       #########
  #.>...###       #############          ###### #.......###

              #...........#           ##....## ####....## #......#
              #############            ######     ######  ########


The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging.  Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the underscore 
in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is 
found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. 
The temples are populated by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should he 
step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which 
means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving 
the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Fire Temple are arrayed as follows:.


  #######
  #.....#                                       #########
  #.>...###       #############          ###### #xxxxxxx###

PCs are denied entrance to the lower CoC until they have the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, 
held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm in the ToEF, and the game stalls at this point. PCs can 
continue to gain experience levels by staying on available cavernous levels (for instance) 
in order to have a better chance in the Tower. Ultimately, however, boredom will set in and 
the PC will have to face the Tower. Obtaining the Fire Orb is a huge hurdle to get over and 
marks a division between the earlier, beginning parts of the game and the latter parts of 
the game. Some players also believe it marks the division between beginning and advanced 
players.

The Tower of Eternal Flames consists of four levels. They are all very, very hot. This 
causes damage to both the PC and his equipment, whether worn or in the pack. To protect the 
PC, fire resistance or immunity is necessary. See section 0.12.1 about fire resistance.

To protect the PC (other than drakelings, see below) completely from the heat in the ToEF, 
the PC must have four sources of fire resistance. Note that intrinsic fire resistance 
counts as two sources. Thus, for example, a PC with intrinsic fire resistance wearing a 
ring of fire resistance under the elemental gauntlets would take no damage from the heat in 
the Tower.

There are a number of artifacts that grant fire resistance or immunity. Two guaranteed 
examples are the elemental gauntlets (resistance) and the Crown of Science (immunity, but 
also dooms and curses). It is probably not worth wearing the Crown of Science unless the 
situation is desperate, since the bad luck it generates causes firproof blankets and rings 
of ice to fail much more often, in addition to the usual bad effects. There are several 
other nonguaranteed artifacts which grant resistance or immunity to fire. It is worth 
remembering that artifacts are indestructible and so cannot be damaged by the heat in the 
Tower.

Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF. The Mad Minstrel sings a song about this. 
Drakelings, even those with fire immunity, always take damage in the ToEF. This is not 
because of the heat itself but is a secondary effect due to the greatly increased 
metabolism drakelings will suffer from in the ToEF. There is no way around it. In order to 
survive, drakelings must have a means of regeneration or healing in the ToEF. Ideally an 
artifact that causes regeneration should be worn. An alternative is to bring blessed 
potions of extra healing along. It is possible for drakelings to do the ToEF with only 
three or four blessed PoEH if everything is done efficiently with no wasted time.

One technique drakelings (and other races for that matter) can use is to read a blessed 
scroll of magic mapping upon entering a new level of the ToEF followed by teleportation to 
the up stairway. Obviously the PC must have the necessary scrolls, wands or spell and 
teleport control.

The heat in the tower will destroy equipment that is vulnerable to fire. This includes most 
items that are not made of the higher metals mithril, adamantium and eternium. Artifacts 
are of course the exception.

If a PC must wear items vulnerable to fire, a blessed ring of ice is necessary. Uncursed 
rings of ice will not work, they must be blessed. Even with a blessed ring of ice, some 
equipment destruction may occur. Blessed rings of ice seem to protect to the 92-95% level. 
Even wearing two blessed rings of ice does not guarantee worn equipment will not be 
destroyed, although the protection seems to go up to 99+%. A ring of ice is of course not 
necessary if the PC wears only artifacts and items made of the higher metals. Missiles are 
an obvious problem. It is rare to find enough arrows made from higher metals to satisfy an 
archer in the ToEF, for instance. Even rocks are vulnerable to the heat, sometimes 
exploding. Non-artifact slings, bows and crossbows are liable to be burnt or melted. If the 
PC is not doomed or cursed, fireproof blankets (particularly blessed ones) are sufficient 
to protect the PC's pack. Fireproof blankets do not protect worn equipment, of course. If 
the PC is doomed or cursed, for instance from wearing the Crown of Science, which grants 
fire immunity, fireproof blankets seem to disintegrate much more readily.

This whole situation is very vexing, because the ToEF contains a very nasty collection of 
monsters and the PC naturally wants to bring his best equipment with him, but at the same 
time does not want it destroyed.

One thing to remember - rings are never destroyed until the gauntlets worn over them are 
destroyed. Since the artifact elemental gauntlets are available to all PCs, this provides a 
foolproof means of protecting nonartifact rings.

The objective in the ToEF is of course the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. It is held by the 
Ancient Chaos Wyrm who can be found on the top level of the ToEF. This level is typical of 
the levels containing elemental temples. The temple itself occupies half of the level and 
is disconnected. It can only be reached by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the 
level. Since a PC may have his only means of digging destroyed on his way through the 
tower, praying on the top level will result in a pickaxe gift from the PC's god.

The temple itself is occupied by problematic monsters. These include fire elementals, 
chaos servants, fire grues, fire drakes and fire demons in addition to the orb guardian. 
The fire demons and fire grues in particular are annoying because they have a corrupting 
melee attack with a very high to-hit. Even PCs with excellent DV will be hit eventually. 
Taken as a whole, this means that invisibility is very, very desirable in the Fire Temple.

2.19.1 The Ancient Chaos Wyrm

The Ancient Chaos Wyrm holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, the key to the lower parts 
of the CoC. It has a fire breath attack and a corrupting melee attack. In addition it is 
able to cast confusion and an energy ray. It is able to heal its wounds. The ACW can be 
killed in a variety of ways including brute force, although it is preferable to attack it 
from a distance due to its corrupting melee attack. The ACW is vulnerable to cold attacks 
(as are most of the monsters in the temple) and dragon slaying ammo. If it is killed on 
the temple's altar, be extraordinarily careful! If the PC is visible the fire demons will 
sacrifice him instantly. Even if the PC is invisible, fire demons who have been engaged 
in melee will "know" where the PC is and sacrifice him. The safest thing to do is kick 
anything dropped on the altar to an adjacent square before picking it up. The elemental 
altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for 
an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of 
Chaos.

An examination of the Ancient Chaos Wyrm with a blessed stethoscope reveals:

You examine the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 20, Hits: 209, 
Attacks: 3, Damage: 15-51. Speed: 98.


2.20 The Ruined City

The Ruined City is the entrance to the Minotaur Maze, found in the far western central 
part of the wilderness map.

Upon entering the wilderness square containing the ruined city, the following messages 
are generated:

"As you advance into the ruins, you catch a short sight on some strange huge figure...

With fluid motions it disappears into the ruins!

Something seems to be waiting for you...

You enter the ancient street of a long-dead and even longer-forgotten city.

Various trees and shrubs have overgrown the monuments of a former civilization. Strange 
unknown runes cover what remains of ancient palaces and buildings. Some forboding evil 
seems to lurk beneath the peace of death emanating from this strange place."

A map of the ruined city reveals the strange huge figure to be a minotaur mazelord 
guarding the entrance to the minotaur maze hidden behind a secret door:


..................==...................................#........................

..............................................................==................
..............................................................==................
..............................................................==................

The minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance may or may not be hostile. This may be 
alignment dependent (he seems to be hostile to lawfuls), among other things and 
needs further investigation.

There is a lower experience level limit in order to enter the Minotaur Maze, which seems to 
be experience level 22. PCs with lower experience level are frightened away. Likewise, 
there is an upper limit, which seems to be experience level 30. The entrance to the 
Minotaur Maze is covered by an immovable stone block at this point. Given the extremely 
nasty nature of the Minotaur Maze, the player is well advised to have the PC as experienced 
as possible before entering.

The objective is to find the Minotaur Emperor on level seven of the maze. He holds the 
artifact Axe of the Minotaur Emperor.


2.20.1 The Minotaur Maze

The mazes are very challenging, with false doors, false staircases, living walls, and a 
variety of minotaurs, including minotaur mazemasters, mazelords, magi and kings. There is 
no random food generated in the mazes. The minotaurs leave corpses, but they are not good 
to eat because they cause confusion. Minotaurs may drop food when killed. The mazes are 
heavily trapped. The down staircases may lead to false levels, which must be explored only 
to find that there are two up staircases with no down staircase. Eventually the PC will 
find a true level six with a down staircase.

It is very obvious when the true bottom of the maze has been reached, because the following 
level message is generated:

"You feel that this maze level is special in some respect... its convoluted tunnels remind 
you of the brain tunnels of some sinister power lurking beneath the surface of the world 
and ready to strike at any intruders!"

A representative layout of the final level of the minotaur maze is shown here:

                              #####


2.20.1.1 The Minotaur Emperor

The Minotaur Emperor is the central 'M' in the above map, surrounded by minotaur mages 
which are able to cast confusion. When the Minotaur Emperor is killed, he drops several 
items which may vary. One example is:


    blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]     [1200s]
    uncursed potion of strength                                        [4s]
    uncursed potion of cure corruption                                 [2s]
    blessed potion of cure corruption                                  [2s]
    uncursed spellbook of Slow Monster                               [100s]
    uncursed minotaur emperor corpse                                 [240s]
    uncursed topaz                                                     [1s]


A blessed greater ID of the Axe of the Minotaur Emperor reveals:

---------- blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]---------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by -6 and PV by +4.
When used in melee combat it grants a +12 bonus to hit and causes 3d20+16
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -12 bonus to hit and
causes 3d16+6 points of damage.

It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee. 
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the weight of the artifact axe. The weight of the artifact, combined with the 
extraordinary difficulty of the mazes, makes most players completely ignore this location. 
It is in no way necessary to complete the game. This dungeon is one that may (hopefully?) 
be substantially revised in future versions of ADOM.


2.21 The High Mountain Village - part two


2.21.1 The Stone Giant Lord

Sometimes there is a Stone Giant Lord generated outside the High Mountain Village walls 
near where the PC enters from the wilderness. Needless to say, this can be a nasty surprise 
for a relatively low level PC who has descended through the Unremarkable Dungeon at the 
beginning of the game. If you can't run away, an attack with berserk tactics may work if 
the PC has a decent weapon. He is vulnerable to magic.


2.21.2 Hawkslayer

The burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village will join a PC and act as a companion 
providing certain criteria are met: the PC must not be chaotic and the player (*not* the PC) 
must know a secret password ("Iceberg"). The only way to learn the password in ADOM itself 
is drinking from pools, and many players are reluctant to do so. Some players may remember 
Hawkslayer from the computer RPG "Bard's Tale III". The password is the same in that game.  
There is also an experience level requirement which is uncertain.  Level 25 PC's have 
successfully gotten Hawkslayer as a companion, so that stands as a maximum level for the 
requirement at the moment.

Hawkslayer is not super-buff as companions go, but he is not bad.

On arriving at the HMV with a level 15 PC and using a blessed stethoscope on him, 
Hawkslayer was found to be:

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 15, 
Hits: 355, Attacks: 1, Damage: 14-50. Speed: 120.

A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup on September 14th, 2000 described a PC who was 
very careful with Hawkslayer to start, training him in the upper levels of the CoC, 
proceeding to the Big Room then deeper into the CoC until he was able to take on molochs 
and balors. Using a blessed stethoscope on him at that point gave the following:

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 110, DV: 96, PV: 36, 
Hits: 805, Attacks: 11, Damage: 50-86. Speed:120.

Quite impressive.

Hawkslayer uses arrows which can be retrieved for the PC's own use.


2.21.3 Ratling guardians

Two ratling guardians are found at the entrance to the city. They seem to be flavor 
elements more than anything else and play no real role in the plot of the game.


2.21.4 Leggot

Leggot is the shopkeeper in the High Mountain Village. He may offer better prices than 
Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper in Dwarftown, both when selling items and buying items. He does 
not share Waldenbrook's hatred of dark elves.


2.21.5 Ogre guardian

Like the ratling guardians, the ogre guardian plays no real part in the game. He guards a 
prison in the High Mountain Village which holds a few monsters. The ogre guardian does not 
react if the PC opens the jail and kills the monsters within.  If the ogre guardian becomes 
hostile, he is capable of throwing huge rocks at the PC.


2.21.6 Gaab'Baay

Gaab'Baay is of critical importance for those attempting a special ending. She assigns 
several quests; the reward is the Medal of Chaos, which is required to pass through the 
Chaos Gate. She will assign quests only to PCs with chaotic alignment. She will not assign 
quests until the demented ratling has been given six artifacts ("Talk to the mutated 
one."). Her quests are as follows: 1) Bring her the skull of a giant boar. An annoying 
quest. Giant boars can only be found randomly in the wilderness, and rarely leave skulls, 
even for PCs that have Food Preservation at 100. This quest can literally take months of 
game time to complete, causing elapsed game time to exceed the 90 day point at which time 
background corruption starts to accelerate. 2) Bring a potion of cure corruption. These can 
be obtained from Guth'Alak (see section 0.10.2.1.1). It is worth taking the time to get one 
from Guth'Alak, since they are very rare otherwise. 3) Bring the corpse of a farmer. Quite 
often a farmer will be wandering around the outside of the High Mountain Village. Otherwise 
they can be found in Terinyo. It is widely believed that farmers will never leave a corpse 
until this quest is assigned, and leave a corpse every time after this quest is assigned. 
So if you are playing a wild chaotic, use some restraint and don't wipe out all farmers 
just because they are easy to kill. It might also be prudent to kill off the stone giant 
lord outside the HMV if one is generated. You don't want him killing off your farmer. There 
has been a recent report (October 13th, 2000) concerning a farmer that did *not* leave a 
corpse after receiving this quest, so it may be a matter of strong probability rather than 
certainity. 4) Bring a scroll of danger. Another scarce item. If the PC finds one, it 
should be put somewhere safe until it is needed. 5) Bring a wand of monster creation. Note 
that a cursed wand of monster creation will work, but one with zero charges left will not. 
After successfully delivering all of these items, Gaab'Baay produces the Medal of Chaos. 
Note that it, like all parts of the Chaos Trinity, corrupts the PC merely by carrying it. 
Leave it somewhere safe until it is needed.


2.21.7 The Oracle

The Oracle dispenses advice to PCs with all three parts of the Chaos Trinity about 
how to become a chaos god. However, it is no longer necessary to have all three 
parts of the Chaos Trinity to enter the Chaos Gate. Interaction with the Oracle in 
ADOM 1.0.0 has not been thoroughly investigated.

The corpse of the Oracle grants +6 to Learning but also curses and dooms the PC.
Beware of attacking the Oracle.  She is capable of casting Death Ray and shares the 
properties of karmic beings, although she is not named as such.


2.21.8 The malicious doctor

The malicious doctor has a flesh golem companion for sale for 25,000 gold pieces. He plays 
no other part in the game. From the reports of those who have acquired this companion, it 
is not worth the money. If the player wants this companion, it is worth luring the malicious 
doctor to the SMC before buying it. In that case it is generated with much more experience.

Note that the malicious doctor will not sell this companion to lawful PCs.  When lawful 
PCs 'C'hat with him, the game responds with "The malicious doctor eyes you with 
suspicion.  "My office is closed." "


2.21.9 Ratling traders

Ratling traders are occasionally generated in the High Mountain Village. Like many other 
random monsters in the High Mountain Village, they are quite often hostile. If the PC needs 
food at this point, don't kill hostile ratling traders. They may eventually become 
nonhostile and therefore a source of food.


2.21.10 Hidden locations

There are three hidden locations in the High Mountain Village.  Gaab'Baay is located in 
a hidden passageway along the eastern wall.  Two scrolls are located in the doorless 
room in the center of the northern wall.  The only way to enter this room is with 
teleportation.  Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated adjacent to 
and within the room:

  #######
  .#.?.#.
  .#^..#.
  .#####.
  ^......

The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be created.  A teleportation 
trap can also be created on the square where the scrolls lie, of course.

The two scrolls are a cursed scroll of chaos resistance and a "strange 
message".  See section 5.2 for the contents.  The final location is a hidden passage in 
the western wall.  It contains a potion of ultra healing and a staircase behind yet 
another hidden door.  The staircase leads to the northern central part of the wilderness.


2.22 The Rift

The Rift is a wilderness location found in the northwestern mountains, southeast of the 
dungeon containing the Tomb of the High Kings.  The PC must meet several requirements in 
order to enter it.  A climbing set is required (although ADOM 1.0.0 and g16p2, at least, 
have a bug which causes this to be ignored) and the Climbing skill must be at 100.  The PC 
must be at least experience level 18.  If the experience level requirement is not met, the 
game responds with: "You do not feel experienced enough for this daunting task."  Willpower 
must be at least 20 OR Perception must be less than six. 

If all these requirements are met, the PC will still most likely fall on the way down the 
Rift, destroying some equipment in the process. Falling can be avoided by having the 
extremely thin and nimble AND the very light corruptions. This needs further testing. It 
may be that only the very light corruption is required, as per the fortune cookie message 
"Being light as a feather makes you very rifty." Alternatively, it may be that only 
hurthlings can avoid falling with only one of these corruptions, similar to the entrance 
requirements for the Quickling Tree. There are reportedly 27 luck checks on the way down, 
whatever that actually means. Being burdened or strained is probably not a good idea. A 
level 50 PC, not cursed or doomed, with intrinsic Lucky and Fate Smiles, wearing the ankh 
and the Ring of the Master Cat, unburdened, but without the requisite corruptions, still 
fell. It is not possible to bring artifacts only into the Rift, since a climbing set (and 
probably food, although enough *might* be found) is required. Therefore, it is a good idea 
to store the PC's extremely valuable items, such as scrolls of chaos resistance, in a safe 
place before entering the Rift. It is also a good idea to bring every bit of junk, such as 
missiles that do not stack, low quality armor and weapons, scrolls of ill fate, cure 
blindness and the like, low quality amulets, etc. along. These items are fodder for the 
RNG, which hopefully will destroy them rather than valuable equipment. Do not be too 
conservative and leave *all* good equipment behind, because the monsters in the Rift 
dungeon and especially the Sinister Library of Niltrias can be *very* nasty. Hopefully by 
this point, the PC has some decent artifact armor and weapons. A corollary is not to rush 
into the Rift too soon.

It is not necessary to visit the Rift dungeon or the Sinister Library of Niltrias to 
complete the game, and many who play non-spellcasters completely ignore it.

The whole point of entering the Rift is to gain access to the Sinister Library of Niltrias 
- see below.


2.22.1 The Rift dungeon

After the PC climbs (falls) down the Rift, he arrives in the Rift dungeon on RL3. The 
dungeon consists of nine levels, which are numbered in the opposite sense compared to every 
other dungeon in the game (the Tower of Eternal Flames is an exception) - RL1 is the 
bottom, while RL9 is the top. This dungeon features dangerous monsters - greater chaos 
servants, chaos mutants, elementals, greater elementals and higher level quicklings are not 
uncommon. Two up staircases will be found on RL5 or RL6. One leads to the higher Rift 
dungeon level, the other leads into the wilderness in a pass inside the unclimbable 
mountains. A short journey, which again requires a climbing set, leads to the entrance to 
the Sinister Library of Niltrias.


2.22.1.1 The ratling dealer

If the PC was unlucky enough to have his climbing set destroyed during the descent through 
the Rift, another is available from a unique ratling dealer on the bottom level of the Rift 
dungeon. This NPC is nonhostile in an otherwise rather hostile environment. As a 
consequence, it is quite possible for him to be killed by other monsters. If the PC needs a 
climbing set from him, find him quickly and be prepared to pay 50,000 gold pieces for it.


2.22.2 The Sinister Library of Niltrias

The layout of the Library is as follows:


         #########################################        #######
         #..............................##......"#      ###.....###
         #..............................##.##....#     ##...#.#...##

   #.."##"......"##"......"##"............##"."####.#   ##.......##
   #]...1...##".......##"......"##"."##"............#    #########
   ##################################################

The numeral 1 represents secret doors.

The ghost librarian 'G' is nonhostile (see the section below).

There is a certain amount of variation in the items found in the Library; this map was 
generated with a wizard PC. The items in the eastern chamber and the large main room will 
be scrolls rather than spellbooks for non-spellcasters. This is a good thing, since scrolls 
are useful for all classes, while non-spellcasters are often unable to read spellbooks 
efficiently or at all. Note the ] in the southwest corner. It is a climbing set, which is 
required to get back into the Rift dungeon. Equipment may be destroyed while in the 
Library, so it is prudent to leave the climbing set where it is until the PC is finished 
with the rest of the Library. There will be monster guardians found on top of every 
spellbook or scroll. These monsters can be anything and are uniformly dangerous. On a 
recent trip through the Library, a master lich, ancient dragons, a quickling lord, a frost 
giant jarl, a stone giant lord, a moloch and a mimic hivemind were found among others. It 
is wise to bring dragon slaying ammo in case an ancient karmic dragon is generated. 
Likewise, demon slaying ammo or phase daggers are very nice to have in case a (greater) 
moloch is generated.

Wizards who visit the Library will find every spellbook available in the game, including 
Wish. Necromancers, for instance, will not. Necromancers find scrolls in the two large 
rooms and spellbooks in the small northeast room and the hidden passageway. The exact 
details of what class finds Spellbooks vs scrolls is being investigated. Spellbooks can be 
destroyed while in the Library (by blue dragons, for example), so be careful with rare 
spellbooks.


2.22.2.1 The Ghost Librarian

The Ghost Librarian is nonhostile and plays no role in the game under most circumstances. 
However, he can be the source of an important artifact, the Weird Tome. In order to obtain 
the Weird Tome the PC must have Stealth at 100 and spend at least 2000 turns in the Library 
without 'C'hatting to monsters. Currently, wizards, for instance, can cast spells 
throughout their combat in the Library and, after vanquishing the monsters, read some 
spellbooks to pass time before 'C'hatting to the Ghost Librarian. At that point the Ghost 
Librarian will reward the PC with the Weird Tome, which can be exchanged for five cursed 
scrolls of chaos resistance courtesy of the Mad Minstrel. It is impossible to read the 
weird tome. The message generated is: "This book is filled with strange texts written in 
weird letters. You have difficulties concentrating on the text. After a while you manage to 
focus your sight on the text. The text contains a strange collection of tunes, songs and 
instrumental pieces. It seems to be some kind of code, hinting at some ancient powerful 
magic, a scroll or something like that... You fail to decipher it." High level wizards, for 
instance, who attempt to read the Weird Tome are Confused for a considerable length of time. 
Do not try it in a potentially dangerous location!


2.23 The Stone Circle

The Stone Circle is located in the northwest part of the wilderness map. It can only be 
entered by PCs who have satisfied the demented ratling (section 2.5.8). Furthermore, it can 
only be entered during the night of Darknight. Determining exactly when it is available is 
not an exact science. In practice, the PC stands on the circle as soon as it is Darknight 
and repeatedly presses > until eventually he enters.

The Stone Circle is located on a plain. There is an entrance tunnel guarded by two dwarven 
chaos knights who should not be a problem for a PC at this level. The doorway into the 
circle is guarded by two annihilators, who can annoyingly destroy the PC's equipment. 
Ideally the PC should be invisible and destroy them from a distance. The alternative should 
be to hit them as hard as possible with the best melee attack available.

There is a unique pool inside the Stone Circle.  Drinking from it results in the 
message "You feel altered in an eerie way."  It always causes ~2 corruptions.


2.23.1 Keriax

The circle itself contains Keriax, the multi-headed chaos dragon in the center with eight 
writhing masses of primal chaos scattered about the walls of the room. It is important to 
dispatch Keriax quickly, as he has a variety of very nasty attacks. He is able to breathe 
bolts including corrupting bolts, confuses the PC and drains stats if engaged in melee. He 
is vulnerable to the Acid Ball spell and dragon slaying ammo. Potions of blindness work on 
him. Killing him from a distance is highly recommended. His corpse grants large increases 
to Strength, Toughness, Mana and Perception, but also causes *massive* corruption - about 
8 corruptions. If he is killed late in the game and a PC needs corruptions for an Avatar 
of Balance or Ultimate Chaos God ending, this is one way to get them quickly.

The objective here is the Crown of Chaos, which Keriax holds. As with all parts of the 
Chaos Trinity, it corrupts the PC merely by carrying it. Put it someplace safe until it is 
needed.


2.24 The Quickling Tree

The Quickling Tree can be found in any portion of the forested wilderness west of the 
river.  This means that a PC should 's'earch for it in a convenient place, such as next 
to the Mad Minstrel's clearing.  It can be found at any time, but to actually enter it 
usually requires two corruptions: the extrememly thin and nimble and the very light 
corruptions. This is because the PC must weigh no more than ten kilos to enter the tree. 
Hurthlings are often an exception: they can enter the quickling tree with only the thin 
and nimble corruption (which is required under any circumstances).  Also, the weight of 
the PCs inventory is limited to 160 stones.  This means eternium plate mails, crowns of 
leadership and the like are not going to be useful.  In fact it is worth picking up any 
light armor the PC finds throughout the game and identifying all of it at some point in 
case any of it is useful in the quickling tree.

Quicklings use hand crossbows and dark elven quarrels as missile weapons and drop them as 
they are killed. Some prior experience with crossbows is therefore useful. Quicklings fall 
fairly easily in melee, with missile weapons or using magic. They are just very, very fast.

The whole point of entering the quickling tree is to eat the corpses of the quicklings as 
they are killed, which provides speed bonuses. There are plenty of corpses generated for a 
PC with a good Food Preservation skill, so an amulet of hunger or stomacemptia herbs are 
useful in the tree. As would be expected, the higher level quickling corpses give better 
speed bonuses, so the quickling lord corpses should be eaten first. The tree contains a 
quickling king and quickling queen, whose corpses provide the best speed bonuses if they 
are generated, but they also shorten the PC's life span. This is where those potions of 
longevity come in handy for races with relatively short life spans.

The quickling queen stands on a pair of artifact boots, the Boots of Great Speed, greater 
identified as follows:

---------------- boots of great speed [+5, +0] (+30 spd)--------------

When worn it modifies DV by +5 and PV by +0.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 
1d3 points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus 
to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.

It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It modifies your speed by +30.
It grants bad luck.
Wearing it makes you doomed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If it is desired, the PC may tunnel directly south from the entrance room into the room 
containing the high level quicklings.

Time passes very quickly in the quickling tree. It is not unusual to enter on day 70 and 
find that it is day 140 upon emerging. This means the 90 day limit has passed and 
background corruption will become faster. Ideally a PC will do the quickling tree right 
before the final dive to the lowest levels of the CoC.


2.25 The Infinite Dungeon

The Infinite Dungeon is found in the southeastern part of the wilderness map. Prior to 
entering it, the description is "A tiny, strangely distorted cave entry."

The Infinite Dungeon (ID) is truly infinite for all practical purposes. The level number is 
limited by some 32 or 64 bit integer value, but who really cares about that? It would take 
many lifetimes to descend through all its levels, even assuming a PC could survive such a 
trip, which is impossible. The danger level increases with dungeon level; any level greater 
than 200 or so becomes ridiculous.

The ID has some unique characteristics: shops, altars and pools are never generated. Every 
dungeon level is randomly generated, so leaving a level and reentering it results in a 
completely new dungeon level. There is one special level, the SIL, where MaLaKaI resides.

According to the Mad Minstrel, the ID was originally a monument built by the powers of law. 
The incursion of Chaos into Ancardia has twisted it into its current condition.


2.25.1 Filk

Filk is found in the ID on the level corresponding to the number of first-killed monsters 
killed. For example if the first monster killed was a rat and 225 rats have been killed, 
Filk will be found on I: 225. Filk is a quickling bard and the fastest quickling in the 
game with a speed of 1500. His DV/PV is 500/0. He shares the properties of karmics although 
he is not named as such. More about obtaining the Filk quest is found in section 4.3.1.1.


2.25.2 MaLaKaI

MaLaKaI resides in the SIL, found at about level 66 of the ID. He is a chaos knight and 
guards the Sceptre of Chaos. The SIL is not really part of the ID. It is discovered by 
descending through the ID normally, but once left, it can never be found again. This means 
if a PC needs the Sceptre of Chaos, there is only one chance to get it, so be prepared. 
MaLaKaI is quite tough. He is designed to be an opponent for characters above level 40. He 
has a corrupting melee attack.

Conclusive proof that the SIL is not part of the ID is the fact that altars are sometimes 
generated in the SIL. These can come in very handy since MaLaKaI can be sacrificed.


2.26 The Unicorn Quests

Guth'Alak, the druid in Terinyo, will reveal the location of the Greater White Unicorn's 
glade once the PC reaches experience level 30, regardless of the PC's alignment. He asks 
the PC to search a beautiful park in the central forest for a good and noble creature in 
need of help. Upon returning to the central forest, the glade appears as a green asterisk 
near the Old Barbarian's clearing. It is described as "A beautiful park." prior to 
entering.

2.26.1 Yrruir, the Greater White Unicorn

After entering the glade, Yrruir can be found teleporting around randomly. Despite the fact 
that Guth'Alak reveals this location regardless of alignment, Yrruir generally attacks PCs 
with chaotic alignment on sight. There have been rare and scattered reports of chaotic PCs 
who were not attacked. When 'C'hatted with, Yrruir explains that the forces of Chaos have 
stolen a part of his life essence and forged it into his evil counterpart, manifested as a 
Greater Black Unicorn. Yrruir asks the PC to kill his counterpart in order to regain the 
stolen life essence and restore his full powers. If the PC is successful, Yrruir rewards 
the PC with an offer to cleanse all corruption *once* and only once. A player who completes 
this quest has to carefully decide when to take advantage of Yrruir's offer. If the PC is 
badly corrupted prior to entering the lowest parts of the CoC, it will probably be 
necessary to have all corruption removed before the endgame. However, it is best to have 
Yrruir remove all corruption as the last thing the PC does before leaving the Drakalor 
Chain, if the player is concerned with receiving the highest possible score and happiest 
future history after finishing.

2.26.2 Riurry, the Greater Black Unicorn

Riurry can be found in a corrupted glade just east of Yrruir's glade. As an evil chaotic 
being, he of course offers rewards if the PC kills Yrruir when 'C'hatted with. If the PC 
then returns to Yrruir, he is warned not to listen to Riurry's evil babbling. Killing 
Yrruir at this point will result in a significant alignment drop, of course, but causes no 
other noticeable effects. The PC does not lose the Lucky or Fate Smiles intrinsics, nor 
does he gain the Cursed or Doomed intrinsics. Returning to Riurry and 'C'hatting results in 
being rewarded with 1-2 corruptions, a blessed amulet of chaos and 5-7 uncursed potions of 
gain attributes. The player has to decide which path to take. The potions of gain 
attributes are a significant reward. If the player is going for an ultimate chaos god 
ending, it seems logical to accept Riurry's quest. Other PCs may choose this quest if 
corruption is either not a problem or desired for chaos gate entry. The alignment drop may 
also be useful for becoming chaotic around experience level 30 in order to receive 
Gaab'Baay's quests, for those PCs attempting an ultra ending.


2.27 The Bug-Infested Temple

100 PC deaths must be recorded in the adom.cnt file before entry will be allowed.  
There are no experience or level requirements for entry, either for the PC or 
in the HISCORE file.

Some of the walls in the bug temple are diggable, but so many are not that it is not 
possible to make real progress.

The bug temple has been beefed up considerably with the simple addition of the 
see invisible intrinsic for the bugs. Low (or even high) level spellcasters are 
no longer going to be able to finish this area easily.

The rewards have been toned down: only three SoCRs, six PoUH, eight SoMM. The 
wand of fireballs has ten charges, the wand of teleportation has six charges. 

The bug-infested temple consists of two parts: the bug wilderness (BUGWIL) and bug cave 
(BUGCAV). The wilderness part's outer limits are scattered with greater claw bugs, that 
low-level spellcasters can bolt to death (be very cautious!). Around the down staircase, 
there are eight killer bugs.

Note that both greater claw bugs and killer bugs have high speed, breed, have multiple 
attacks and bypass the PC's PV. This means that they are what they're called - killers - 
in melee.

Eating a greater claw bug corpse increases speed, gives +3 Dx and -6 Wi. Eating a killer 
bug corpse also increases speed, gives +6 Dx and -12 Wi.

The layout of BUGCAV:

The 'g's are greater claw bugs and 'i's are killer bugs. ]'s represent named marble statues. 
The numeral 1 represents secret doors. Teleportation doesn't work in BUGCAV.  All the 
marble statues can be picked up and broken, like normal ones. However, there's another 
meaning to them; reading. They're in place to honor the prerelease testing group of version 
1.0.0. Here's a compilation of what they all mean and what you get from them. The format for 
the list is: real name of tester - statue text - reward for breaking the statue, besides 
rocks

Thomas Biskup - "Bassuk Thimosp, Human wizard, who slaughtered the fearful experience 
                 drainer of Prr'rlse." - nothing

Stephen Mackey (Karkadinn) - "Matsep Cheyken, Troll Assassin, who dedicated his life to 
                              harvesting the fish of Vinooresen." - barbed trident of 
                              hunting (+2, 3d5+5)

Markku Rikola - "Molkar Ur-Yack, the Orcish Elementalist, who unraveled the secret of the 
                 legendary Ball of Hellfire, unfortunately slaughtering himself in the 
                 process." - wand of fireballs (10 charges)

Olli "Shader" Juhala - "Da Sehr Jhuala Liol, Dark Elven Beastfighter. He was unexepctedly 
                        engulfed by the primal chaos of sorcerer coined." - 3 * scroll of 
                        chaos resistance

Adrian Bancilhon - "Raidan Nichloban, Gray Elven Barbarian. Slow of tongue, Slow of speech, 
                    The healing arts, He helped to teach." - 6 * potion of ultra healing

Note that some of the rewards' stats may vary and that they are all *cursed*. However, those 
potions of ultra healing, scrolls of magic mapping and especially the scrolls of chaos 
resistance are a gift that makes visiting the Bug Cave very worthwhile.

There is one more statue, an "unfinished statue of an unquestionably famous hero" in honor 
of Raymond Martineau. No reward for breaking him down, though.

Breaking all the statues stops the breeding of the bugs and results in an appropriate line 
in the accomplishment list at the end of the game.
