# 2.20 The Ruined City

The Ruined City is the entrance to the Minotaur Maze, found in the far western central 
part of the wilderness map.

Upon entering the wilderness square containing the ruined city, the following messages 
are generated:

"As you advance into the ruins, you catch a short sight on some strange huge figure...

With fluid motions it disappears into the ruins!

Something seems to be waiting for you...

You enter the ancient street of a long-dead and even longer-forgotten city.

Various trees and shrubs have overgrown the monuments of a former civilization. Strange 
unknown runes cover what remains of ancient palaces and buildings. Some forboding evil 
seems to lurk beneath the peace of death emanating from this strange place."

A map of the ruined city reveals the strange huge figure to be a minotaur mazelord 
guarding the entrance to the minotaur maze hidden behind a secret door:

```
The minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance may or may not be hostile. This may be 
alignment dependent (he seems to be hostile to lawfuls), among other things and 
needs further investigation.

There is a lower experience level limit in order to enter the Minotaur Maze, which seems to 
be experience level 22. PCs with lower experience level are frightened away. Likewise, 
there is an upper limit, which seems to be experience level 30. The entrance to the 
Minotaur Maze is covered by an immovable stone block at this point. Given the extremely 
nasty nature of the Minotaur Maze, the player is well advised to have the PC as experienced 
as possible before entering.

The objective is to find the Minotaur Emperor on level seven of the maze. He holds the 
artifact Axe of the Minotaur Emperor.


## 2.20.1 The Minotaur Maze

The mazes are very challenging, with false doors, false staircases, living walls, and a 
variety of minotaurs, including minotaur mazemasters, mazelords, magi and kings. There is 
no random food generated in the mazes. The minotaurs leave corpses, but they are not good 
to eat because they cause confusion. Minotaurs may drop food when killed. The mazes are 
heavily trapped. The down staircases may lead to false levels, which must be explored only 
to find that there are two up staircases with no down staircase. Eventually the PC will 
find a true level six with a down staircase.

It is very obvious when the true bottom of the maze has been reached, because the following 
level message is generated:

"You feel that this maze level is special in some respect... its convoluted tunnels remind 
you of the brain tunnels of some sinister power lurking beneath the surface of the world 
and ready to strike at any intruders!"

A representative layout of the final level of the minotaur maze is shown here:

## 2.20.1.1 The Minotaur Emperor

The Minotaur Emperor is the central 'M' in the above map, surrounded by minotaur mages 
which are able to cast confusion. When the Minotaur Emperor is killed, he drops several 
items which may vary. One example is:


* blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]     [1200s]
* uncursed potion of strength                                        [4s]
* uncursed potion of cure corruption                                 [2s]
* blessed potion of cure corruption                                  [2s]
* uncursed spellbook of Slow Monster                               [100s]
* uncursed minotaur emperor corpse                                 [240s]
* uncursed topaz                                                     [1s]


A blessed greater ID of the Axe of the Minotaur Emperor reveals:

---------- 
blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]
---------

It is an artifact.

When worn it modifies DV by -6 and PV by +4.
When used in melee combat it grants a +12 bonus to hit and causes 3d20+16
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -12 bonus to hit and
causes 3d16+6 points of damage.

It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee. 
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the weight of the artifact axe. The weight of the artifact, combined with the 
extraordinary difficulty of the mazes, makes most players completely ignore this location. 
It is in no way necessary to complete the game. This dungeon is one that may (hopefully?) 
be substantially revised in future versions of ADOM.
