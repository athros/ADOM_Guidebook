# 0.5 Spells and Mindcraft

## Spells - description and usefulness

There is a very good section on spells including damage and range in the ADOM manual. The diameter of ball spells is dependent upon Willpower / 8. However, this diameter only increases as a multiple of sixteen since ball spells radiate symmetrically; the minimum diameter is two. Therefore getting Willpower to 24, for instance, does not increase the diameter.  Willpower must be increased to 32 for the diameter to increase to four, 48 for the diameter to increase to six, 64 for the diameter to increase to eight, etc.

Note that spells become more costly to cast (in terms of PP) as the number of available castings decreases. Thus a spell will increase in cost as the number of available castings decreases below 100 or so, becoming very noticeable as the number drops below about 20.  This is class dependent but will affect all classes to differing extents.  Note also that the number of available castings is not a simple "decrement by one each time the spell is cast" type of formula.  Again depending on class, the difficulty of casting the spell and probably other factors this will vary.  For example, casting Light with 1000 castings available to a level 40 wizard may decrease the available castings by one, while casting Death Ray with 20 castings available with a level 30 archer may reduce the available castings to zero.  These are purely hypothetical examples but should give an idea of the trends.

Some general remarks about spells: Ball spells are extraordinarily useful since no monsters shrug them off. They are wonderful when the PC is surrounded, of course. It is worth switching to Coward tactics and waiting to be completely surrounded before casting. Since they are relatively costly in terms of PP, it is useful to destroy the maximum number of enemies with each casting. Fire magic is particularly effective against cold-based creatures and undead including mummies. Cold magic is particularly effective against fire-based creatures. Bless damages undead. Healing spells can be cast at monsters including companions (but don't use them on slaves!). Wish is a unique spell. It is very difficult to learn, probably impossible if the PC has teleportitis. Such PC's must travel to a location where teleportation is impossible, such as the the Assassin's Guild, the Tomb of the High Kings or the elemental temples (the desirability is in that order due to background corruption in all of those locations). Furthermore, PC's will usually reach Starving! status while attempting to learn Wish. Tactics to deal with this include eating a blessed stomfillia to become Bloated, waiting just until the PC returns to Satiated, then eating another blessed stomfillia. It may be necessary to drink additional satiating potions, such as potions of toughness or potential toughness, even when the double blessed stomafillia tactic is used. Alternatively, PC's without teleportitis can use a room that has the "rich flavour" special effect, where PC's will never become hungry. Wish is extraordinarly expensive to cast and also drains a random stat by -10 when cast. If the PC must cast it, be prepared for the stat drain. Plan to cast it in a special room that lowers spell costs, and on Silvernight or Darknight, if possible, according to the PC's alignment.
