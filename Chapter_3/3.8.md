# 3.8 The Earth Temple

The Earth Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 42-46. The layout, on the right side 
of the level, is as follows:

```

```

The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Some of the walls in 
the Earth Temple are undiggable, but there is a way into every room by digging - it may 
take some experimentation to find it. Note the traps. The numeral 1 is used to indicate 
secret doors. Note the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic 
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and 
moves). The standard warning about standing on altars applies - the stone grues (and 
possibly other monsters) found on this level are capable of speech and will sacrifice the 
PC. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which 
means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before 
retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Earth Temple are arrayed as follows:

```

```

They are: 
* s - stone snakes
* x - stone grues
* Y - stone golems
* C - chaos servants
* E - earth elementals
* F - (in the center) the Ancient Stone Beast

To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters. All of the monsters 
here with the exception of stone golems and chaos servants are able to travel through 
stone, so in practice the PC will probably be attacked before penetrating the walls of the 
temple. Stone snakes are poisonous, stone grues have a corrupting melee attack and earth 
elementals throw rocks, apparently using slings which are often left behind when they are 
killed. Earth elementals have many hitpoints and regenerate. Exact statistics for earth 
elementals and stone grues are not available from a blessed stethoscope - the game responds 
that the monster "rather seems to be a piece of furniture." The monster memory states that 
earth elementals have about 210 hitpoints, stone grues about 240 hitpoints. They both have 
a PV of 40, so use a powerful melee attack or they will take forever to kill. All of these 
monsters will fall to brute force or magic.

## 3.8.1 The Ancient Stone Beast

Attacking the Ancient Stone Beast may seem like attacking a wall of granite. It has over 
1000 hitpoints:

You examine the Ancient Stone Beast. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 10, PV: 60, Hits: 1091, Attacks: 1, Damage: 15-60. Speed: 91.

Not fast, not overwhelming PV, but it can take a formidable amount of bashing to bring down 
this creature. Not helping matters is the fact that it regenerates wounds and has a 
corrupting melee attack.

The Ancient Stone Beast holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth, greater identified as follows:

----------------- 
uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10}
----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 3d9+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your toughness attribute by +10.

(earthquake + corruption when 'U'sed)
