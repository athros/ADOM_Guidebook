# 3.5 Battle bunnies

This level is found on D: 33 or D: 34. You will know when you find it, because the level 
message "You suddenly sense an intense tension." is generated. It consists of a long 
northern corridor connected to a long southern corridor. Traversing these corridors allows 
time for the inhabitants of the level, battle bunnies, to breed. This is to be avoided as 
they breed like, well, rabbits. It can quickly get out of control. The best way to deal 
with the level is to immediately tunnel (or teleport) south by any means at the PC's 
disposal and kill Bugs, the leader of the level. This drastically reduces or eliminates 
further breeding of the bunnies. Kill the remainder and descend. Note that scrolls of 
vermin control do not work on the level, instead exploding to produce a green cloud of 
foul smoke.
