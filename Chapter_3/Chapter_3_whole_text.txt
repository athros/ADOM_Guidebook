3.                        LATE GAME STRATEGIES


3.1 The wall of flames

A wall of flames is encountered around D: 27. Even if the PC has fire immunity, it cannot 
be passed without the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire. The Orb is found in the Tower of Eternal 
Flames. The wall of flames forces the player to retrieve it before proceeding. See section 
2.19 for more on the Tower of Eternal Flames.


3.2 The Eternal Guardian

The Eternal Guardian is found one or two levels before the Casino. He guards the down 
staircase on the level. He only allows peaceful passage of PCs if they are wearing the Ring 
of the High Kings, obtainable from the Tomb of the High Kings (section 2.12). It is 
definitely possible to pass him without the ring, although it presents special problems. 
The obvious tactic of teleporting him away from the stairs does not work, as he is 
resistant to teleportation. Trying to kill him in melee or with missiles is more or less 
pointless, since he reincarnates even if the PC manages to kill him, which is very 
difficult. If a PC wants to pass him without the RotHK, it is best to make him angry such 
that he chases the PC, followed by a quick teleport to the down stairs and descent.

Note, however, that passing the Eternal Guardian without the Ring of the High Kings means 
that the shortcut to the surface through Darkforge (see section 3.4) will not work in the 
down direction - a distinct disadvantage.


3.3 The Casino

The Casino is found on D: 30 or D: 31. The layout is as follows:


#####                                 ######

The guaranteed monsters found here are casino guards (the @s outside the Great Gift 
Shoppe), a big casino guard (guarding the down staircase) and the shopkeeper (the @ 
inside the Great Gift Shoppe). The $s in the body of the Casino are not piles of gold, 
but rather slot machines. There will be a number of non-hostile monsters wandering 
about the Casino and the Great Gift Shoppe.

It is possible to win essentialy unlimited amounts of gold from the slot machines. 
Intrinsic Dooming, Cursing, Lucky and Fate Smiles have no effect. Wearing items that 
grant Luck (the hidden property) or the Lucky/Fate Smiles intrinsics make no difference. 
The fastest way to accumulate money is to choose a machine that costs 24 gold pieces to 
play and 'h'andle the lever. Place a heavy object on the spacebar of your keyboard. 
Check back after five minutes or so by picking up the gold on the floor. There should be 
quite a pile.

As long as the technique above is used - simply leaving the spacebar depressed - all of 
this gambling will take place during a single game turn, so the PC will not be spending 
hours of game time in the Casino getting corrupted. This is after all D: 30 or D: 31, 
moderately deep in the CoC. So resist the temptation to check on your winnings every 30 
seconds! ;-)

The payout from the slot machines follows a precise formula, shown below: 

Item               Two alike        Three alike
----               ---------        -----------

kobold                  1x                 1x
goblin                  4x                 8x
hobgoblin               9x                27x
gnoll                  16x                64x
ogre                   25x               125x
wizard                 36x               216x 
ettin                  49x               343x
giant                  64x               512x
hero                   81x               729x
treasure hoard        100x              1000x
magical wand          121x              1331x
magical ring          144x              1728x
magical weapon        169x              2197x
magical armor         196x              2744x
artifact              225x              3375x
ancient hero          256x              4096x
dragon                289x              4913x
ancient dragon        324x              5832x

As an example, two goblins results in a return of 4x the original bet, for a profit of 3x 
the original bet.  The average payout works out to approximately 24x the original bet.  
This has been verified empirically, and agrees with theory.

Be aware that if the PC uses the slot machines, the Big Casino Guard will block the down 
staircase and expect the PC to spend his winnings - and more - in the Great Gift Shoppe, 
which is ridiculously overpriced. This problem can be solved by teleporting the Big Casino 
Guard. This transports him to another location on the level. He does not become hostile, 
does not move and behaves exactly as if he were still blocking the stairs (this is probably 
a bug).


3.3.1 Strategies for robbing the Casino

There are two monsters that are particularly tough on the level: the shopkeeper and the big 
casino guard. Their vital statistics:

Big casino guard: You examine the big casino guard. Diagnosis: Level: 2, 
DV: 19, PV: 24, Hits: 307, Attacks: 2, Damage: 17-72. Speed: 106.

Shopkeeper: You examine Orgovek, the human shopkeeper. Diagnosis: Level: 11, 
DV: 10, PV: 20, Hits: 926, Attacks: 6, Damage: 21-36. Speed: 195.

These stats do not change after the monsters become hostile.

The key event in robbing the Casino is causing the monsters on the level to become hostile, 
whether or not the PC has actually picked up anything from the Great Gift Shoppe. There are 
a number of events that will cause the monsters to become hostile, including attacking the 
guards or the shopkeeper and zapping a wand of destruction that damages any of the guards 
or the walls of the Great Gift Shoppe. Once the monsters become hostile, a number of things 
happen. First, the number of guards on the level approximately triples. They cluster around 
both the up and down staircases and are plentiful elsewhere. Second, the teleportation 
restrictions inside the Great Gift Shoppe cease. This means the PC is free to teleport to 
any location on the level, but since the up and down staircases will be blocked by guards, 
it is not possible to teleport to these locations and leave the level.

Invisibility is strange on the level. The casino guards and the big casino guard see 
invisible. The shopkeeper welcomes an invisible PC when he enters the Great Gift Shoppe, 
but when an invisible PC picks up an item, the shopkeeper does not immediately block the 
door. The standard "shopkeeper stares at your position with great intensity" message must 
be generated before he blocks the door. However, the shopkeeper instantly sounds an alarm 
when an undetected invisible PC who has picked up an item leaves the Great Gift Shoppe. 
Despite this, the shopkeeper does not see the invisible PC as he flees through the body of 
the Casino.

None of the monsters on the level are able to see in darkness. However, some will still 
cluster around the PC in darkness, while others, including the big casino guard who 
ordinarily blocks the down staircase, will wander aimlessly. This means that if a PC needs 
to rest and recover hitpoints, or pray for healing, or drink healing potions, darkness is 
your friend. A PC can stand in one spot indefinitely in the dark. The tendency of the 
monsters to cluster around the PC or wander about also means they will leave the vicinity 
of the staircases. Thus a PC can rob the Casino, cast Darkness, wait, then teleport to the 
down staircase. This is risky, however, since if the PC is doomed by robbing the Casino 
(see below) there is a 1 in 1000 chance of an instadeath each turn from a grue attack (see 
section 0.13.4).

The stats for the shopkeeper above should make it clear that speed is critical when robbing 
the Casino. Anything that increases speed is valuable - rings of speed, speed boosting 
potions and especially seven league boots. It is possible to make the shopkeeper hostile by 
throwing missiles or zapping a spell at him, ideally from as far away as possible, then 
literally outrun him out of the Great Gift Shoppe. This is one way the Casino can be robbed 
without any spells whatsoever.


3.3.2 Consequences of robbing the Casino

The consequences of robbing the Casino vary according to a couple of factors. First is the 
alignment of the PC. Lawful PCs will likely be cursed and doomed. Neutral PCs will likely 
be cursed, perhaps doomed. Chaotics will probably get away with no cursing or dooming. 
Lawful and neutral PCs will move their alignment towards chaotic. This may or may not be 
visible on the main screen. It is known for PCs to be so lawful by this point in the game 
that their alignment does not vary from L+ despite robbing the Casino. The second factor is 
exactly what transpires during the robbery. Killing the shopkeeper in the process of 
robbing the Casino is not recommended for crowned champions of Law or Balance, of course. 
Attacking the guards on the way out or after dragging them down to the next level should 
not cause an alignment drop as they will be hostile at that point.

The cursing and/or dooming is obviously the biggest problem PCs face after robbing the 
Casino. Fortunately, there is a shortcut to the surface of the Drakalor Chain (see section 
3.5) available one or two levels below the Casino. This makes it possible to get to a 
coaligned altar near the surface quickly and sacrifice in order to get rid of the unwanted 
cursing or dooming, although it is possible at this point in the game that the player might 
want to exploit those intrinsics. In any case, remember where those coaligned altars are 
near the surface! If you plan to rob the Casino, they can be essential.


3.4 The shortcut to the surface

A shortcut to the surface from deep in the CoC will be found at about D: 32. This is very 
handy for those who need access to the surface to complete quests for ultra endings, visit 
the quickling tree, do the Unicorn quests, etc. It is generally found two dungeon levels 
below the Casino. It is obvious because there will be two up staircases on the level. The 
shortcut causes the PC to emerge in Darkforge. The fact that it is close to the Casino is 
handy if the PC needs access to an aligned altar to remove dooming and/or cursing caused 
by robbing the Casino.

If the Eternal Guardian was passed peacefully by wearing the Ring of the High Kings, this 
shortcut works in both directions. If the Eternal Guardian was *not* passed peacefully, 
the shortcut works in the up direction only. This is a powerful argument for retrieving the 
RotHK and *not* attempting to pass the EG by trickery or combat.


3.5 Battle bunnies

This level is found on D: 33 or D: 34. You will know when you find it, because the level 
message "You suddenly sense an intense tension." is generated. It consists of a long 
northern corridor connected to a long southern corridor. Traversing these corridors allows 
time for the inhabitants of the level, battle bunnies, to breed. This is to be avoided as 
they breed like, well, rabbits. It can quickly get out of control. The best way to deal 
with the level is to immediately tunnel (or teleport) south by any means at the PC's 
disposal and kill Bugs, the leader of the level. This drastically reduces or eliminates 
further breeding of the bunnies. Kill the remainder and descend. Note that scrolls of 
vermin control do not work on the level, instead exploding to produce a green cloud of 
foul smoke.


3.6 The Cat Lord

The Cat Lord is found on D: 35 or D: 36. The level message "This level somehow seems to be 
removed from the rest of the world." is generated upon entering the level.  Note that 
teleportation is not allowed on the level and ceiling traps may therefore be generated. If 
the PC has killed no cats, the PC may 'C'hat with the Cat Lord, in which case the following 
message is generated: "The cat lord growls: "Thou hast respected the cat race. Thus I shall 
grant upon you this gift." The cat lord suddenly is gone. Nothing but a tiny ring is left 
of him." In this case, congratulations are due. The PC has the most powerful ring in the 
game, the artifact Ring of the Master Cat. It is enormously helpful in the end game, 
particularly because it grants +16 to Dexterity when the PC's dexterity is being destroyed 
by corruption. The ring's full properties are listed below:


-------------- ring of the master cat [+0,+5] {Dx+16} (+16 spd) ------------------

When worn it modifies DV by +0 and PV by +5.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +16.
It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee. It modifies your speed by +16.
It makes Fate smile upon you.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the PC has killed cats, the Cat Lord will be hostile. His power is dependent on the 
number of cats killed, becoming greater each time a cat is killed.


3.7 The Air Temple

The Air Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 38-42, below the Casino. The layout, on 
the left side of the level, is as follows:


       ##################                  ###########   #####################

The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the traps. The 
numeral 1 is used to indicate secret doors. Note the underscore in the center of the 
temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least 
until he is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. The air demons 
(or Yulgash himself) will sacrifice the PC instantly should he step on it. The elemental 
altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for 
an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of 
Chaos. The monsters in the Air Temple are arrayed as follows:

They are: r - vapor rats
          x - air grues
          & - air demons
          C - chaos servants
          E - air elementals
          @ - (in the center) Yulgash, the Master Summoner

The Air Temple level features intermittent electrical discharges which will destroy both 
worn items and those in the pack, as well as damaging PCs without good shock resistance 
or immunity. It is highly advisable to leave precious non-artifact items on the level 
above or below the Air Temple. To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the 
monsters. The presence of the secret doors is actually helpful, since ideally the PC can 
take on the monsters outside of the temple first, without alerting the air elementals and 
grues. Yulgash will often teleport out of the Temple, however. The air elementals are 
very tough with many hitpoints and the ability to breathe lightning bolts, which can 
destroy the PC's equipment. The grues and demons are troublesome because they have a 
corrupting melee attack that has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be 
hit by them eventually - a good reason to develop the PCs missile weapon skills.  
Invisibility is tremendously useful. Only the chaos servants and Yulgash see invisible.


3.7.1 Yulgash, the Master Summoner

As befits his name, Yulgash is liable to summon anything up to and including great wyrms 
and ancient karmic dragons. Killing him as soon as he is aware of the PCs presence is 
therefore a top priority. Yulgash teleports, has a corrupting melee atack and is a 
spellcaster.

Yulgash holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Air, greater identified as follows:

------------------ uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10}-----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +10.

(air elemental pet + corruption when 'U'sed)

3.8 The Earth Temple

The Earth Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 42-46. The layout, on the right side 
of the level, is as follows:

       #########################           ##########################


The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Some of the walls in 
the Earth Temple are undiggable, but there is a way into every room by digging - it may 
take some experimentation to find it. Note the traps. The numeral 1 is used to indicate 
secret doors. Note the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic 
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and 
moves). The standard warning about standing on altars applies - the stone grues (and 
possibly other monsters) found on this level are capable of speech and will sacrifice the 
PC. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which 
means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before 
retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Earth Temple are arrayed as follows:

They are: s - stone snakes
          x - stone grues
          Y - stone golems
          C - chaos servants
          E - earth elementals
          F - (in the center) the Ancient Stone Beast

To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters. All of the monsters 
here with the exception of stone golems and chaos servants are able to travel through 
stone, so in practice the PC will probably be attacked before penetrating the walls of the 
temple. Stone snakes are poisonous, stone grues have a corrupting melee attack and earth 
elementals throw rocks, apparently using slings which are often left behind when they are 
killed. Earth elementals have many hitpoints and regenerate. Exact statistics for earth 
elementals and stone grues are not available from a blessed stethoscope - the game responds 
that the monster "rather seems to be a piece of furniture." The monster memory states that 
earth elementals have about 210 hitpoints, stone grues about 240 hitpoints. They both have 
a PV of 40, so use a powerful melee attack or they will take forever to kill. All of these 
monsters will fall to brute force or magic.


3.8.1 The Ancient Stone Beast

Attacking the Ancient Stone Beast may seem like attacking a wall of granite. It has over 
1000 hitpoints:

You examine the Ancient Stone Beast. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 10, PV: 60, Hits: 1091, Attacks: 1, Damage: 15-60. Speed: 91.

Not fast, not overwhelming PV, but it can take a formidable amount of bashing to bring down 
this creature. Not helping matters is the fact that it regenerates wounds and has a 
corrupting melee attack.

The Ancient Stone Beast holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth, greater identified as follows:

----------------- uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10}----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 3d9+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your toughness attribute by +10.

(earthquake + corruption when 'U'sed)

3.9 Sharad-Waador's quest and the blue dragon caves

Sharad-Waador is an ancient karmic wyrm found in the unreal cave system branch off the CoC 
at D: 46 or D: 47. He is found on level 4. He is nonhostile and will assign a quest to kill 
an ancient blue wyrm, Srraxxarrakex, who is his mortal enemy. This is a difficult quest and 
is in no way necessary to finish the game. Part of the difficulty is the presence of 
Srraxxarrakex's children: many different blue dragons including ancient blue dragons which 
see invisible. Blue dragons breathe lightning bolts, which will damage a PC without very 
good resistance or immunity as well as destroying items, both worn and in the pack. There 
is no way to prevent the item destruction. Items can be left in Sharad-Waador's room for 
safekeeping while on the quest. Sharad-Waador does not move unless he is attacked or the PC 
reneges on the deal to take the quest.

To receive the quest, the PC must first decide what equipment will be left behind, drop it, 
stand on the down staircase in Sharad-Waador's room, then 'C'hat with him. This sequence of 
events is necessary because Sharad-Waador will not chat with the PC until the PC is on the 
down stairs, and after chatting with the PC demands that the PC descend immediately. If the 
PC moves off the staircase at this point, Sharad-Waador becomes hostile.  A trick that can 
be used is leaving some of the PC's precious but 'might be needed' equipment *on* the 
stairway.  Sharad-Waador does not become hostile if the PC emerges from the blue dragon 
caves without moving from the stairway.  This provides a means of protecting very valuable 
equipment (such as scrolls of chaos resistance) that might be needed to save the PC's life.

The blue dragon caves consist of five levels, DL: 1-5. In addition to the many varied blue 
dragons found in these caves, other nasty high level monsters may be found here, including 
chaos wizards and greater molochs, for example. It is wise to have some means of dealing 
with greater molochs along, whether it is simply speed for running away, phase daggers or 
demon slayers. High speed is virtually essential for killing Srraxxarrakex, as well. Upon 
entering the fifth and final level of the caves, the following message is generated: "These 
ancient caves are covered with marks from huge reptiles... hundreds of such marks." 
Srraxxarrakex will be found on this level.

When the blue dragon caves were first implemented, there were complaints that the quest was 
impossible due to the item destruction. The amount of item destruction has been toned down 
a bit in more recent gammas, and some players will actually scum these caves because 
killing the blue dragons generates large amounts of valuable equipment, sometimes including 
very valuable items such as scrolls of chaos resistance or rings of djinni summoning.

The main reason for taking this quest however, is because Sharad-Waador rewards the PC with 
a huge pile of equipment for completing it. Among this equipment, which generally does not 
contain anything remarkable, is the artifact dagger Needle. Be very careful with this pile of 
equipment.  Needle is indistinguishable from ordinary daggers until it is identified.  It is 
best to have a blessed scroll of identify at the ready, to identify all the treasure the PC 
has taken from the blue dragon caves and the heap of stuff Sharad-Waador provides.  The junk 
can then be safely dropped without risking misplacing Needle.  When Needle is combined with 
its twin, the artifact dagger Sting, held by the Assassin Prince, they become the most 
powerful weapons in the game, at least in terms of raw to-hit and to-damage. If a PC planning 
an ultra ending makes it this far, check section 2.11.3.1 and get the Filk quest from the 
Assassin Prince. He can then be killed for Sting, if desired.


3.9.1 Srraxxarrakex

Sraxxarrakex is a very powerful ancient blue wyrm, more powerful than any other ancient 
wyrm in the game. He is, as might be expected, immune to shock. One of the things that 
makes him so difficult to defeat is the fact that he naturally regenerates *and* casts 
powerful healing spells at the same time. He has three attacks per round, so he can, for 
instance, breathe a lightning bolt, attack in melee, cast heal, while still getting natural 
regeneration *per round*. His vital statistics:

You examine Srraxxarrakex, the ancient blue wyrm. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 60, PV: 40, Hits: 951, Attacks: 3, Damage: 20-76. Speed: 113.

This means the PC must be capable of dealing massive amounts of damage quickly in order to 
defeat him. He can be attacked in almost any way, including melee, missiles and magic. He 
is of course vulnerable to dragon slaying missiles and melee weapons.

Killing him is worth 1.6 million experience points.


3.10 The Mana Temple

The Mana Temple is found on its own level, MT, the last level of the UL, the unreal cave 
system. The UL is a side branch off the main CoC at D: 46 or D: 47. The layout, on the 
right side of the level, is as follows:


 #################
 #........./.....#                        ############################

                                            ###


The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation does not work on this level. The walls of the Mana 
Temple itself are undiggable. It must be entered through the single square room at the 
southwest of the Temple. Note the traps completely surrounding the Temple. Ceiling traps 
replace teleportation traps in the Mana Temple. The numeral 1 is used to indicate secret 
doors. Note the underscore in the eastern center of the temple. This is the chaotic 
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until he is disturbed and moves). 
The standard warning about standing on altars applies - many of the monsters are capable of 
speech and will sacrifice the PC. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions 
of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in 
the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos. The monsters in the Mana Temple are arrayed 
as follows:

They are: e - magebane eyes
          e - magedoom eyes
          C - chaos servants
          C - annihilators
          C - chaos wizards
          @ - Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage

To attack the temple, the PC must travel through the trap-filled tunnel around the temple. 
During this, the magebane eyes and magedoom eyes will be draining the power points of the 
PC. Classes which are dependent on power points are well advised to bring along blessed 
scrolls of power. If possible, a wand of trap detection should be saved for the Mana 
Temple. This is a much faster way of detecting the traps than using the Detect Traps skill, 
especially when combined with the Farsight spell or a necklace of the eye. The faster this 
tunnel is traversed, the less time the eyes have to drain the PP of the PC. The Mana Temple 
ranks with the nastiest places in the game. Many players do not enter the temple itself, 
instead staying in the corridor. Using this technique, the monsters can be fought one at a 
time. Even so, the chaos wizards are summoners, so the PC can still be surrounded by 
summoned monsters in the corridor. The objective using this method is to wait for 
Nuurag-Vaarn to exit the temple, kill him, collect the Orb and flee.


3.10.1 Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage

Nuurag-Vaarn is a difficult opponent, to say the least. He has a corrupting melee attack. 
He is very fond of casting spells, especially Death Ray and Darkness. Entering the Mana 
Temple without a means of death ray resistance is virtual suicide. He is also very good at 
confusing the PC and is a stat drainer. He is immune to elemental attacks other than acid. 
He is vulnerable to humanoid slaying ammo; this is a good way to attack him if the PC can 
maintain a clear shot at him through all the monsters, summoned and otherwise, in the 
temple.

Nuurag-Vaarn's vital statistics:

You examine Nuurag-Vaarn, the invisible Chaos Archmage. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 60, PV: 30, Hits: 938, Attacks: 2, Damage: 9-36. Speed: 112.

To summarize the prerequisites needed to fight Nuurag-Vaarn:

1 - Death Ray resistance - essential
2 - confusion resistance - essential
3 - light source - essential
4 - humanoid slaying ammo - recommended

Nuurag-Vaarn holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana, greater identified as follows:

------------------ uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana {Ma+10}----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d16+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +10.

(full PP, +12 to PP, +3 Mana, corruption when 'U'sed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.11 D: 48

Warning: following the procedures on this page is irreversible. The PC cannot return to 
the higher levels of the CoC. Have everything you will need with you before proceeding.

Level 48 of the Caverns of Chaos contains five elemental anomalies corresponding to the 
five Chaos Orbs. They are guarded by four elemental grues with the usual corrupting grue 
melee attack. The mana anomaly is not guarded by a grue, but rather a chaos wizard. The 
idea here is to 'U'se each Chaos Orb while standing on the appropriate elemental anomaly. 
A transcript of the results and some remarks follow:

Mana anomaly - green underscore:
--------------------------------
You face a strange small rift in the air leading into unknown dimensions of pure energy.

Do you want to drop the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana into the rift? [y/N]

You drop the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana into the strange rift.

For some seconds a strange silence fills the whole level.

Suddenly the rift disappears.
--------------------------------

Using the mana orb in this way causes the PC's power points to drop to zero and a loss 
of two points of the Mana attribute.  For this reason, spellcasters may want to do this 
anomaly first, to allow the maximum time for PP to regenerate.  Blessed scrolls of power 
are very useful here.

Earth anomaly - brown underscore:
---------------------------------
You face a man-high stone column with a round opening in the center.

Do you want to put the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the hole? [y/N]

You fit the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the stone column.

For some seconds the whole level is shaking.

Suddenly the column disappears.
---------------------------------

The shaking of the level seems to imply some sort of minor earthquake, but the level 
takes no damage as a result.

Water anomaly - blue underscore
-------------------------------
You face a shimmering pool of unknown depth.

Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into shimmering 
pool? [y/N]

You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into the shimmering pool.

For some seconds the air gets very humid on this level.

Suddenly the humidity dispenses and everything is normal once more.
-------------------------------

The humidity generated by this operation will damage anything vulnerable to water damage 
- be careful, have waterproof blankets, do not have unprotected iron armor or weapons 
exposed.

Air anomaly - bright blue underscore
------------------------------------
You face a man-high whirlwind rising out of a hole in the ground.

Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the 
whirlwind? [y/N]

You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the whirlwind.

For some seconds a roaring wind soars through this level.

Suddenly everything is silent and the whirlwind disappears.
------------------------------------

This roaring wind seems to do no damage.

Fire anomaly - red underscore
-----------------------------
You face a man-high bonfire.

Do you want to throw the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the 
roaring bonfire? [y/N]

You throw the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the bonfire.

For some seconds the whole level is filled with an immense heat. You resist the searing 
flames.

Suddenly the level cools down once more and the bonfire is gone.
-----------------------------

The fire anomaly is by far the most dangerous. It will damage anything vulnerable to fire. 
This includes any monsters that may be wandering the level. That includes cats. It is very 
disappointing and frustrating to kill a cat in this way and have the hard-fought-for Ring 
of the Master Cat explode at this point. Zap a wand of monster detection or read a scroll 
of monster detection before using the fire orb in the anomaly. It also damages a 
necromancer PC's slaves. It may not kill them, but undead are vulnerable to fire damage, 
and a partially fried and very angry extremely experienced level 110 quickling king lich 
is not something the PC wants to worry about at this point. Leave undead slaves on D: 47. 
Pets, companions and slaves cannot cross D: 49 anyway.

After all of the orbs are in their proper places, the PC receives the following message:

You hear a grating sound in the distance.

This means the up staircase has reversed direction and now points down. There is no way to 
return to D: 47 at this point. The PC is now committed to going through D: 49 to D: 50, 
either to win or die.


3.12 D: 49

Level 49 of the Caverns of Chaos is called the frictionless level by many players. It is 
covered with ice that is too slippery to cross by normal means. Spiked boots do not help. 
Teleportation fails on this level. Since the ice is (almost) frictionless, throwing objects 
will propel the PC in the opposite direction (remember freshman physics?). There is also a 
special gift available on this level. If the PC equips a potion of uselessness in the 
missile slot and throws it, a deity rewards the PC for finding a use for the potion with a 
random artifact. The following messages are typical of those generated upon entering and 
throwing a potion of uselessness:

There is a stair leading downwards here.
You climb downwards...
The ground seems to be covered with a very slippery layer of ice. It's cold here! 
There is a stair leading upwards here.
[T]arget -- [Z] Abort. (x2)
The uncursed potion of uselessness thuds into an obstacle. The uncursed potion of 
uselessness shatters! You slide to the west. You suddenly hear a booming voice!
"*YE REALLY HAST FOUND A USE FOR THIS PETTY ITEM*"
"*YER INGENUITY SHALL BE REWARDED*"
Something is lying before you. Out of ammunition.
Reload with the heap of 14 uncursed rocks (+1, 1d4)? ([y]es, [n]o, [q]uit) Q
Blessed shining silver bracers (10s) are lying here. You shudder. You resist the icy blast.
You pick up the blessed shining silver bracers. You sneeze. You resist the icy blast.

This particular PC was very lucky and received the Bracers of War. As mentioned the 
artifact is random and can be potentially worthless. Note the cold-related messages. This 
is troublesome for drakelings, who will find themselves frozen nearly solid. A reduction in 
speed to 10 is typical. If the player is aware of this, it is not a huge problem. Upon 
entering CoC 50, cast Improved Fireball adjacent to the PC or zap a wand of fire at the 
PC's location repeatedly until speed is reasonable again.

The following map shows the results of using rocks and a sling to travel through CoC 49. 
Note the rocks are closer together in the final central corridor. This was deliberately 
done to show the results changing when the PC switched from a sling of the long shot to a 
normal sling. Use whatever is handy, effective and expendable to travel through CoC 49 - 
rocks, arrows, guaranteed returning missiles such as a boomerang, even that worthless pile 
of sis the PC has been dragging around forever. Do NOT use missile weapons that are not 
guaranteed to return such as the rune-covered trident or the Hammer of the Gods. Given the 
nature of CoC 49, the PC may never be able to stop exactly where they fell to retrieve 
them.

The walls of D: 49 are diggable with the Mystic Shovel spell, a wand of digging, a pickaxe, 
the Elementalist class power and a monk's kicking ability. Monks using their ability will 
be propelled backward one square, and the rock may or may not shatter, making this 
technique somewhat awkward. The newly dug area remains too slippery to cross. This offers 
drakelings a potentially faster way through D: 49.


                                                                          ###

3.13 D: 50

Level 50 of the Caverns of Chaos is the final battleground for those not attempting an 
ultra ending. It is appropriately challenging. The Mana Temple will have provided an idea 
of what CoC 50 will be like for PCs that make it this far. There will undoubtedly be many 
additions and revisions to this section.

The level layout on the left side of the level is as follows:


############                             #######
#&.........#                             #.....#

#&.........############      #######       #################################
############


The numeral 1 represents secret doors.

The right side of the level is random. Note the dungeon features. The & symbols in this map 
do not represent demons but rather levers. These control the state of the Chaos Gate, 
represented by the 8 in the large central room. These features cannot be seen in the color 
map on the web site.

Note that all of the & symbols in the color map *do* represent balors - there are balors 
standing on the levers.

There are two basic ways to finish CoC 50: The object of the level is to 'h'andle both of 
the levers, thus closing the Chaos Gate and ending the incursion of chaos into Ancardia. 
This can initially be accomplished by clearing the northern and southern corridors and 
'h'andling the levers. However, some of the monsters on CoC 50 are intelligent enough to 
reopen the gate. To ensure that the levers remain in their closed position, the PC has two 
choices: ensure the levers remain in their closed position forever, or make sure the 
following intelligent monsters are all dead: Fistanarius, balors, ghost lords and chaos 
wizards.

A third alternative is available for those PCs who aspire to a special ending, which 
require Chaos Gate entry. Much of the combat on D: 50 can be bypassed as soon as it is 
possible to teleport to the location of the Chaos Gate. In order to do this, Fistanarius, 
the greater balor, must move from his position on top of the Chaos Gate. See section 4 
Special Endings, for more about the (extensive) requirements for attempting a special 
ending.

Wands of destruction ending

One relatively easy way to finish CoC 50 is to use wands of destruction. This, and the 
variation using wands of door creation / monster creation below, require substantially less 
combat than a traditional ending. The level is diggable, so it is possible to tunnel into 
the northern and southern corridors and clear them. Remember they are closed by secret 
doors. During this, some of the intelligent monsters may sense what is happening - ghost 
lords may pass through the walls, balors may teleport in. When both corridors are cleared, 
'h'andle one of the levers to close it. Zap a wand of destruction to destroy it in its 
closed state. This will open the walls to the large central room and make all of those 
monsters pursue the PC. Teleport to the other lever, 'h'andle it to close it and zap a wand 
of destruction to destroy it. Teleport to the up staircase and leave. You've won. Here is 
an example of what the level might look like after doing this:

Note most of the balors, but not Fistanarius, have teleported to search for the PC. The 
chaos mutants in the center, the greater chaos servants in the central corridor, the 
writhing masses of primal chaos and most of the ghost lords have not even moved.

Wands of door creation / monster creation ending

This is a variation on the above technique. It is somewhat safer in that the big room never 
has to be opened at all, but both wands of door creation with at least six total charges 
and a wand of monster creation with two charges are required. 

This method starts with the same approach as outlined above - clear the northern and 
southern corridors after entering them by digging. Zap a wand of door creation twice to 
almost enclose one of the levers. Handle the lever to close it. Zap a wand of monster 
creation to create a monster on the closed lever to prevent balors from teleporting to that 
space. Zap a wand of door creation to trap the monster on that square. Teleport to the 
other lever and repeat. Teleport to the stairs and leave.

This method has some problems, as does the wands of destruction ending above. Regardless, 
they are much, much easier than the alternative of killing the intelligent monsters on the 
level. First, some monsters will open doors, so it may be necessary to keep zapping, 
killing the monster and repeating until something suitable is generated. Locking the door 
will solve this problem if the PC has an appropriate key, which he should by this time. 
Second, you must be quick, which is why teleportation is recommended. It is quite likely 
that the balors will start teleporting to investigate the levers, and they are quite 
capable of opening the doors or smashing them if locked, killing the monster standing on 
the lever and reactivating the lever. Third is simply a philosophical problem. The PC has 
not really fulfilled the requirements for winning, but is taking advantage of the fact that 
the level will remain frozen after he leaves. Nonetheless, the game counts this as a win.
