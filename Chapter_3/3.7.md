# 3.7 The Air Temple

The Air Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 38-42, below the Casino. The layout, on 
the left side of the level, is as follows:

```
       ##################                  ###########   #####################
       #................#                  #.........#   #....././...........#

```

The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is disconnected. Entry 
must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Note the traps. The 
numeral 1 is used to indicate secret doors. Note the underscore in the center of the 
temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least 
until he is disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. The air demons 
(or Yulgash himself) will sacrifice the PC instantly should he step on it. The elemental 
altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for 
an ultra ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of 
Chaos. The monsters in the Air Temple are arrayed as follows:

They are: 
* r - vapor rats
* x - air grues
* & - air demons
* C - chaos servants
* E - air elementals
* @ - (in the center) Yulgash, the Master Summoner

The Air Temple level features intermittent electrical discharges which will destroy both 
worn items and those in the pack, as well as damaging PCs without good shock resistance 
or immunity. It is highly advisable to leave precious non-artifact items on the level 
above or below the Air Temple. To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the 
monsters. The presence of the secret doors is actually helpful, since ideally the PC can 
take on the monsters outside of the temple first, without alerting the air elementals and 
grues. Yulgash will often teleport out of the Temple, however. The air elementals are 
very tough with many hitpoints and the ability to breathe lightning bolts, which can 
destroy the PC's equipment. The grues and demons are troublesome because they have a 
corrupting melee attack that has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be 
hit by them eventually - a good reason to develop the PCs missile weapon skills.  
Invisibility is tremendously useful. Only the chaos servants and Yulgash see invisible.


3.7.1 Yulgash, the Master Summoner

As befits his name, Yulgash is liable to summon anything up to and including great wyrms 
and ancient karmic dragons. Killing him as soon as he is aware of the PCs presence is 
therefore a top priority. Yulgash teleports, has a corrupting melee atack and is a 
spellcaster.

Yulgash holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Air, greater identified as follows:

------------------ 
uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10}
-----------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points 
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3 
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +10.

(air elemental pet + corruption when 'U'sed)
